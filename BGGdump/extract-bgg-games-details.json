[{"bggId":224517,"name":"Brass: Birmingham","description":"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Roxley","designer":"Gavan Brown, Matt Tolman, Martin Wallace","artist":"Lina Cossette, David Forest, Damien Mammoliti","honors":"2018 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":8.65426,"avgWeight":3.9068},{"bggId":220308,"name":"Gaia Project","description":"Gaia Project is a new game in the line of Terra Mystica.

As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.<br/><br/>Unlike many deck-building games, you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.<br/><br/>Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.<br/><br/>Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).<br/><br/>Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br/><br/>Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br/><br/>Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__thumb/img/eQ69OEDdjYjfKg6q5Navee87skU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3163924.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__original/img/HlDb9F365w0tSP8uD1vf1pfniQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3163924.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Stonemaier Games","designer":"Jamey Stegmaier","artist":"Jakub Rozalski","honors":"2016 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":8.19036,"avgWeight":3.4347},{"bggId":167355,"name":"Nemesis","description":"Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror.

You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Build an industry tile<br/>    Build a rail or canal<br/>    Develop an industry<br/>    Sell cotton<br/>    Take a loan<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).<br/><br/>Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:<br/><br/><br/>     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.<br/>     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.<br/>     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.<br/>     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__thumb/img/AghH1bAEhqzvyRcP3cy5G-rz0So=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3469216.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__original/img/3ffdJj5Pz6HQrg09Kh8ecTen-TY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3469216.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Roxley","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Gavan Brown, Lina Cossette, Peter Dennis, David Forest, Eckhard Freytag, Damien Mammoliti","honors":"2007 Jogo do Ano Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":8.18747,"avgWeight":3.8601},{"bggId":124361,"name":"Concordia","description":"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea.

Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.<br/><br/>Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__thumb/img/kMLIpeqA6UcUvQg2AdMwwQoEIfU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336469.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__original/img/rkHKwkUqpQC7PAGG7n2gbrcQiUY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4336469.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Cranio Creations","designer":"Tommaso Battista, Simone Luciani","artist":"Mauro Alocci, Antonio De Luca, Roman Roland Kuteynikov","honors":"2019 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":8.20903,"avgWeight":4.0738},{"bggId":175914,"name":"Food Chain Magnate","description":"&quot;Lemonade?

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__thumb/img/5fLo89ChZH6Wzukk36bhZ-EpBS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic158548.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__original/img/DOgIp57F7tKZvxeITGAd3e_Q9as=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic158548.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2002,"publisher":"alea","designer":"Andreas Seyfarth","artist":"Harald Lieske, Franz Vohwinkel","honors":"2002 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game Winner","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.94459,"avgWeight":3.2745},{"bggId":102794,"name":"Caverna: The Cave Farmers","description":"Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies.

Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.<br/><br/>In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.<br/><br/>After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__thumb/img/NyoufH5YBFCh1rKy4uy76bR4ITk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__original/img/7DlaMCmuoJzm9AzelmStYIDgutI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4503733.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Wehrlegig Games","designer":"Cole Wehrle","artist":"Cole Wehrle","honors":"2019 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":8.29169,"avgWeight":3.8404},{"bggId":31260,"name":"Agricola","description":"Description from BoardgameNews<br/><br/>In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__thumb/img/GHGdnCfeysoP_34gLnofJcNivW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__original/img/toobKoejPiHpfpHk4SYd1UAJafw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic831744.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Lookout Games","designer":"Uwe Rosenberg","artist":"Klemens Franz","honors":"2007 Meeples' Choice Award","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,5],"avgRating":7.90504,"avgWeight":3.6373},{"bggId":221107,"name":"Pandemic Legacy: Season 2","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The world almost ended 71 years ago...<br/><br/>The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world.

Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.<br/><br/>In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction.

Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.<br/><br/>The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game.

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?<br/><br/>Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br/><br/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.<br/><br/>All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br/><br/>With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__thumb/img/I1oCwOcGxAOVx2VE2LcXuKWoLvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1872452.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__original/img/vxK08kQAEn5qPbejK2CUTyWOsig=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1872452.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Corey Konieczka, Nikki Valens","artist":"Anders Finér, David Griffith, Ed Mattinian, Patrick McEvoy, Dallas Mehlhoff, Emilio Rodriguez, Magali Villeneuve, Drew Whitmore","honors":"2013 Board Game Quest Awards Best Coop Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":7.76595,"avgWeight":3.3226},{"bggId":42,"name":"Tigris & Euphrates","description":"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.<br/><br/>The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:<br/>- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.<br/>- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.<br/>- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.<br/><br/>The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:<br/>- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces<br/>- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.<br/>- earn 2 coins<br/>- take 2 temporary workers<br/>- jump ahead in turn order<br/>- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you<br/><br/>Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers.

At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Shōgun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?<br/><br/>Rising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.<br/>Over the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.<br/><br/>In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.<br/>Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. <br/>Each Season is divided into five phases: <br/>1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, <br/>2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, <br/>3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,<br/>4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and <br/>5) Seasonal Cleanup.<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__thumb/img/UNKv6MWzJUAwhhP7-ng6HoinRa8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3880340.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__original/img/pKJ1XyLN4hvHim5eRj2VJHijv1E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3880340.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"CMON Global Limited","designer":"Eric M.

In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these actions?

This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony!

After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy a card<br/>     Deploy a worker<br/>     Hire an architect for a wonder<br/>     Special action provided by a card<br/><br/><br/>Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players.<br/><br/>When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored. At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>See 'More information' below for link to rules, etc.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-hn7gA50ci0n7j9u_-jHhA__thumb/img/rJqh_lHJ45NZHtxC5uq8xH2_Hzk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1591406.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-hn7gA50ci0n7j9u_-jHhA__original/img/1RkLWWHzepOqacKarc1176UofVs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1591406.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Lautapelit.fi","designer":"Rustan Håkansson, Nina Håkansson, Einar Rosén, Robert Rosén","artist":"Ossi Hiekkala, Jere Kasanen, Paul Laane, Frida Lögdberg","honors":"2013 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.61936,"avgWeight":3.5439},{"bggId":310873,"name":"Carnegie","description":"Carnegie was inspired by the life of Andrew Carnegie who was born in Scotland in 1835.

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.<br/><br/>The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.<br/><br/>Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:<br/><br/><br/>    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.<br/>    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.<br/>    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.<br/>    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.<br/>    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.<br/><br/><br/>If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rzSmS-GD8_pGl9bWo07FWQ__thumb/img/jo2betPcpo8mVZPIs993TT_nOMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5638431.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rzSmS-GD8_pGl9bWo07FWQ__original/img/TFtpuGRO0cbVjWl03YhtzTBRk5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5638431.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Stronghold Games","designer":"Vital Lacerda","artist":"Naomi Robinson, William Bricker, Vital Lacerda","honors":"2014 Golden Geek Best Strategy Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.80921,"avgWeight":4.3617},{"bggId":9216,"name":"Goa","description":"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.<br/><br/>After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.<br/><br/>The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.<br/><br/>The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9sbSKcc-Fm8Od5wwuf3kgg__thumb/img/pb63LQr94bzh4Z6ofLNJoijRlxU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1215969.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9sbSKcc-Fm8Od5wwuf3kgg__original/img/kNoFZrbwsvMvs_iKWeKBHYLka5Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1215969.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2004,"publisher":"Hans im Glück","designer":"Rüdiger Dorn","artist":"Oliver Freudenreich","honors":"2004 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game 3rd Place","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.56885,"avgWeight":3.3734},{"bggId":285967,"name":"Ankh: Gods of Egypt","description":"Play as a god of ancient Egypt, competing to survive as society begins to forget the old ways, so that only you and your followers remain.<br/><br/>Build caravans, summon monsters, and convert followers in your quest to reign supreme in Ankh: Gods of Egypt.

One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.<br/><br/>This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.<br/><br/>The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer).

On a generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling &quot;energy dice&quot; that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__thumb/img/6nMV_Bdtm2ShipBJfGle36DY1-U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3048617.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__original/img/fr4sH1ViKPtRys-gjCY4dY8UuQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3048617.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Minion Games","designer":"Tom Jolly, Luke Laurie","artist":"Josh Cappel, Jeffrey Edwards","honors":"2016 Golden Geek Best Strategy Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":7.76789,"avgWeight":3.0382},{"bggId":97207,"name":"Dungeon Petz","description":"Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business &ndash; breeding and selling petz.

And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan&rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash &mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait &mdash; what&rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook &hellip; considerably, in fact &hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip;<br/><br/>Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.<br/><br/>Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__thumb/img/RCh0FVF5BT9-ATms0Wc_6hs2z5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic93485.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__original/img/ujxqaJuxawHp28WMvjv4JyUp0ac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic93485.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2005,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Jeroen Kesselaar, Ynze Moedt","honors":"2006 International Gamers Awards - General Strategy; Multi-player Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.87758,"avgWeight":3.9837},{"bggId":59294,"name":"Runewars","description":"Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players.

While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.<br/><br/>A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__thumb/img/Rd6POAEmJOEtwKB7bSDTKPsL_9k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic738119.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__original/img/wrLHO6mElyCGzog0aHzJ9KE-SeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic738119.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Z-Man Games","designer":"Kasper Aagaard, Christian Marcussen","artist":"Ben Nelson, Chris Quilliams","honors":"2011 Golden Geek Best Board Game Artwork/Presentation Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.39405,"avgWeight":3.2449},{"bggId":111341,"name":"The Great Zimbabwe","description":"The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.<br/><br/>In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.<br/><br/>Here's the flavour text from the rules:<br/><br/>The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...<br/><br/><br/>The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.<br/><br/>Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.<br/><br/>Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__thumb/img/tGLIa6i13UQJv2-Xj47XEHZrDRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1400856.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__original/img/gtQ1AZ8xqbjEq9KhLK6aoz9TQm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1400856.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Ynze Moedt","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.82187,"avgWeight":3.6738},{"bggId":291572,"name":"Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile","description":"In Oath, one to six players guide the course of history in an ancient land.

China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.<br/><br/>The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.<br/><br/>G&ugrave;gōng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor. If only 1 player succeeds in doing so, he wins. If several players succeed, the player with the most VPs among those players wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HJ263_vhLJ58QUWPvMVbEg__thumb/img/uRX0KCJmdwWZiL8Z7fo4V-mwm_E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4143114.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HJ263_vhLJ58QUWPvMVbEg__original/img/pUen2yvuqACs8rQ_aEt4SKViEfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4143114.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Game Brewer","designer":"Andreas Steding","artist":"Andreas Resch, Noah Adelman","honors":"2018 Golden Geek Best Board Game Artwork & Presentation Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.47447,"avgWeight":3.0922},{"bggId":299659,"name":"Clash of Cultures: Monumental Edition","description":"Clash of Cultures: Monumental Edition brings back the classic game of exploration, expansion, and development with the Clash of Cultures base game and the Civilizations and Aztecs expansions in one box!

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.<br/><br/>Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.<br/><br/>Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.<br/>Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.<br/><br/>The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.<br/><br/>Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?<br/>Beware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large&hellip;.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wY6k5MmdPH3NVXsJ-SgtMw__thumb/img/Su3JBW4OIe8Qt6nXEyUcMOJtqsM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1762708.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wY6k5MmdPH3NVXsJ-SgtMw__original/img/I-0fr4331yRjHcjZlXiSzq0Lbnw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1762708.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"What's Your Game?","designer":"Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro, Paulo Soledade","artist":"Mariano Iannelli","honors":"2013 Jocul Anului în România Advanced Finalist","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.56935,"avgWeight":4.3032},{"bggId":17405,"name":"1846: The Race for the Midwest","description":"1846 is an 18xx game that traces the westward expansion of railways across the Midwestern United States.<br/><br/>As in other 18XX games, the winner is the player with the greatest combined wealth (cash on hand + value of stock held + value of private companies owned) at the end of the game.

During operating rounds, corporations will lay track, build stations, run trains for revenue to be paid out as dividends or withheld, and buy trains.  The majority shareholder of each corporation acts at its president, making all decisions during operating rounds.

The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction.

You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.<br/><br/>Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.<br/><br/>Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

Each turn goes as follows:<br/><br/>1. Action Phase: Perform three actions, such as play new cards, get new cards from the market, speculate on cards in the market, buy land, or redeploy troops.<br/>2.

An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).<br/><br/>Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.<br/><br/>Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.<br/><br/>Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.<br/><br/>&quot;Reimplements&quot;<br/><br/>     StarCraft (video game)<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tXwlK5uyyxaMzXG65NZ3Xg__thumb/img/-93qv9jIN6Lx9DZUCg9W8i-t6P8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic265704.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tXwlK5uyyxaMzXG65NZ3Xg__original/img/J5-KA7kHSx-6ln75ntNNy9OeBwA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic265704.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Corey Konieczka, Christian T.

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.<br/><br/>Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency<br/><br/>Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.

After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.<br/><br/>After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't. Whoever has the most points after three years wins.

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.<br/><br/>Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.<br/><br/>Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.<br/><br/>In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.<br/><br/>Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/asueS9har0y10uk672cbGw__thumb/img/80v16ohwO4WQNiR6Yoo_9IHI2NY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2242246.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/asueS9har0y10uk672cbGw__original/img/nq95-sVAgp9Hc4nNi8UMrJt2LFw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2242246.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"What's Your Game?","designer":"Marco Canetta, Stefania Niccolini","artist":"Mariano Iannelli","honors":"2014 Meeples' Choice Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.57083,"avgWeight":3.8319},{"bggId":552,"name":"Bus","description":"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.<br/><br/>Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.<br/><br/>Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.<br/><br/>Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__thumb/img/4M7epe99tiI_bvQGRPMo7OvxSko=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4908538.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__original/img/xzDBpZR94KRpjiKJRW5ZqYWKmMo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4908538.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1999,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Herman Haverkort, Tamara Jannink, Daan van Paridon, Thijs van Paridon, Joris Wiersinga","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.58289,"avgWeight":3.0438},{"bggId":154825,"name":"Arkwright","description":"In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.<br/><br/>To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.<br/><br/>You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.<br/><br/>Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).<br/><br/>After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.<br/><br/>Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.<br/><br/>After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.<br/><br/>Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.<br/><br/>To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__thumb/img/zM8pwB0LilhgIQd67L7mOgeZ25o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2776693.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__original/img/mT2Oug5XPaSWIW0M-nNoZW4qmSY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2776693.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Capstone Games","designer":"Stefan Risthaus","artist":"Harald Lieske","honors":"2014 The Golden Elephant Award Best Heavy Board Game Winner","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.81785,"avgWeight":4.5968},{"bggId":306040,"name":"Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road","description":"Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road is a tense economic game charting the rise and fall of the greatest city in the world.<br/><br/>In Merv, players are vying to amass power and wealth in the prosperous heart of the Silk Road.

Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.<br/><br/>If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.<br/><br/>In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others.<br/><br/>In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of carbon emissions permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.<br/><br/>Money, CEPs, green power plants that you've built, UN goals you've completed, company goals you've met, and expertise you've gained all give you victory points (VPs), which represent your company's reputation &mdash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game &hellip; in addition to saving the planet, of course.<br/><br/>This new totally re-designed edition of CO₂ features a completely new iconography, an entirely new rulebook with lots of 3D pictures for easy comprehension of the rules, more balanced gameplay, a new events deck, improved and streamlined mechanisms, and upgraded wooden components for the power plants instead of the cardboard tokens in a game with a shorter play length.

Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.<br/><br/>In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.<br/><br/>In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.<br/><br/>Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.<br/><br/>On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing&mdash;receiving a dividend each round.

Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us.

To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.<br/><br/>There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience?

And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.<br/><br/>This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:<br/><br/>Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.<br/><br/>The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.<br/><br/>A brief description from the rule book:<br/><br/>Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India.<br/><br/>Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. <br/>To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut.<br/><br/>For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). <br/>The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn.<br/><br/>Ships at landings that are &quot;complete&quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.<br/><br/>During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters).<br/>Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.<br/><br/>The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.<br/><br/>Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.<br/><br/>Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round.

In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buy new cards from the common display<br/>    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)<br/>    Train/Educate your people<br/>    Build/found cities<br/>    Take money<br/><br/><br/>To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.<br/><br/>It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.<br/><br/>Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III.

Is it Prussia's defeat or is it Prussia's glory?<br/><br/>All against one &ndash; but only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives.

These opposing forces - the two sides of human nature - struggle to control and shape the Inside World, the metaphorical representation of an evolving personality.<br/> Cerebria introduces a unique theme and numerous innovative mechanisms. The game is centered around the player-controlled Spirits, and the Emotion cards controlling Cerebria&rsquo;s areas, each with their own stats and abilities.<br/><br/>The Spirits can perform up to three actions on their turn. These include moving between Cerebria&rsquo;s Realms and Frontiers, using the specific powers of the Realms, invoking and upgrading Emotion cards, removing opposing Emotions, and building Fortresses to consolidate their influence on certain areas. The Actions cost Willpower, gained primarily by absorbing from the Origin&rsquo;s Spheres in the middle of the board. Both Bliss and Gloom also have a rare shared team resource, Ambition, enabling them to use the game&rsquo;s most powerful effects.<br/> The teams can score points either by accomplishing publicly known minor objectives (the Intentions), or completing their major objectives (the Aspirations), which change dynamically during the course of the game. Scoring Aspirations allows players to add Bliss and Gloom Fragments to the Identity, built in the middle of the board. These are key moments in the game: Cerebria&rsquo;s state is in constant flux, but the Fragments are permanent imprints of a game state during the scoring events.<br/> The game is won by the side with more influence over the finished Identity, thus becoming the dominant force in Cerebria.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xZ6CZ8_J4CEwR7TT8_3hKw__thumb/img/DpP7gvOmzFeWhBmdk5XgdKFmK1k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3568532.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xZ6CZ8_J4CEwR7TT8_3hKw__original/img/7Ni8b05mJH5CcKoFVbRlYrOnR1g=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3568532.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Mindclash Games","designer":"Richard Amann, Viktor Peter, István Pócsi, Frigyes Schőberl","artist":"Pedro A.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.<br/><br/>Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.<br/><br/>The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!<br/><br/>Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...<br/><br/>The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z6R7dbTOJB3dEhNOz5PPTQ__thumb/img/qsmEJDaHpXQkcmbKJbqWvZ9lz_s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2004236.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z6R7dbTOJB3dEhNOz5PPTQ__original/img/PKcW1oNZEyAjV4-YrzKfTVlmOX8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2004236.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Asterion Press","designer":"Andrea Chiarvesio, Pierluca Zizzi","artist":"Miguel Coimbra, Fabio Gorla, Federico Musetti, Roberto Pitturru","honors":"2014 Golden Geek Best Strategy Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.18807,"avgWeight":3.1719},{"bggId":139898,"name":"Brew Crafters","description":"It's a time of regrowth in the old urban center, and the hippest and best beer crafters have gathered both hops and hopes in building the best brewery in the city.

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.<br/><br/>The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.<br/><br/>The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T6X1-I6St8OW50bhewvL3A__thumb/img/zqCqSXlCc4ZFzEHwMY5rYzI2dnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1273353.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T6X1-I6St8OW50bhewvL3A__original/img/PeWeYPgj5qqjbf1ToP_YXAFXT5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1273353.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1925,"publisher":"(Public Domain)","designer":"Harold Vanderbilt","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":7.44907,"avgWeight":3.8725},{"bggId":9440,"name":"Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India","description":"A board game for two to five players with elements of area control and simultaneous action selection.

Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.<br/><br/>Dominant Species Veterans<br/><br/>For players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): <br/><br/>     Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board. This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn&rsquo;t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance. <br/>     Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer &lsquo;competitive&rsquo; with other players. In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it. Domination of an element is how you acquire &ndash; and try to maintain &ndash; control of the special pawns.<br/>     Animals no longer have default special abilities. Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box. The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards. <br/>     Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy. Special pawns can &lsquo;bump&rsquo; an opponent&rsquo;s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked. They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only). There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed. And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__thumb/img/JNsz6atITE84iWPiiq7ki1LaSGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5998666.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__original/img/tDNHjJ6160FjCjpY8oJuaNPQ7_k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5998666.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Chad Jensen","artist":"Chad Jensen, Chechu Nieto","honors":"2021 Cardboard Republic Striker Award Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":8.07634,"avgWeight":3.8684},{"bggId":554,"name":"La Città","description":"Set in the Italian countryside, this game features various city-states vying for population.

Many species are eager to ally themselves with a powerful empire to gain security and stability in a chaotic and difficult time.<br/><br/>As you explore and interact with planets, you will discover unfolding stories of the fringe.

Beginning with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus, a period of 50 years saw nearly as many different men seize imperial power over all or part of the Empire, until the reforms of Diocletian in 284 AD ushered in an era of peace.<br/><br/>In Time of Crisis, 2-4 players take the reins of Roman dynasties, gathering and wielding influence among the senate, military, and people of Rome to ensure that their legacies are remembered by history instead of being lost to the mists of time.  Starting from control of one province and a few low-value cards, you are challenged to establish your base of power during this fragile period of Roman history.  You must build your armies, take control of valuable provinces, develop your support, and defend yourself against barbarian incursions, inopportune events, and the machinations of your political opponents.<br/><br/>Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.  It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience.  The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board.  This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.  Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns.  Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?  Or will you master a blend of all three?  In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!  However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical.<br/><br/>All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire.  Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzbAevS1luPIpQZgdqRJrA__thumb/img/jvuKcxYKE49i-mqwPfI3BqFr-Dg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3372197.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzbAevS1luPIpQZgdqRJrA__original/img/niUQQ0MZL8rl1Sgi0T3jgrHUPYg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3372197.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Ergo Ludo Editions","designer":"Wray Ferrell, Brad Johnson (I)","artist":"Rodger B.

We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us.

With Chinchaysuyu, Antisuyu, Qullasuyu, and Kuntisuyu &mdash; the four regions of the new empire &mdash; now ripe for conquest, the time has come for Pachacuti's true successor to arise.<br/><br/>Gather your people from the villages below and use their unique abilities to strategically place them where they can perform the greatest tasks for you. Climb the steps of the Sun Temple, reaping the rewards of your piety. Build structures that both nourish your people and provide you with benefits no other has at their disposal. Muster an army and conquer villages in the four realms of Tawantinsuyu. Prove yourself a worthy successor to Pachacuti and lead the Inca to glory!<br/><br/>During Tawantinsuyu: The Inca Empire, players place workers onto various locations on the game board, performing actions, collecting resources (potatoes, corn, stone, and gold), constructing buildings and stairs, sculpt statues, expanding their military strength, and collecting weavings.<br/><br/>The game board features a hill located within the old Inca capital of Cusco, the sides of which are terraced and divided into five sections. Atop the hill sits the Coricancha, The Golden Temple, the most important temple of the Inca Empire. Within the Coricancha, each player has a High Priest. On the terraced sections below exist a variety of worker placement locations, interconnected by paths and individually marked by symbols. On your turn, you must either place a worker onto a location outside the Coricancha OR choose two of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Recruit one worker.<br/>     Take two god cards.<br/>     Draw two army cards and keep one of them.<br/>     Move your High Priest one or two steps clockwise within the Coricancha.<br/><br/><br/>When placing a worker, you must first discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay one gold. Once placed, the worker remains on the game board for the rest of the game! Each worker placement location is connected to exactly three action spaces. You must always perform at least one of these actions. However, for each adjacent worker (i.e., connected to your worker's location via direct path through one of the action spaces) that matches the type of worker just placed, you receive one additional action!<br/><br/>While some locations will result in you being able to perform multiple actions, other actions and placements may be more desirable, especially since each of the five types of workers has a unique ability:<br/><br/><br/>     Warrior: Remove one of the adjacent workers, placing it in your player area.<br/>     Craftsman: Gain +1 action if placed onto a craftsman space.<br/>     Architect: Gain +1 action if placed onto an architect space.<br/>     Courier: Decreased placement cost; +1 action if it's the first worker placed within a given area.<br/>     Priest: Take one god card; you may pay one potato to gain +1 action.<br/><br/><br/>All god cards feature one of the different symbols found on the worker placement locations. Before placing a worker, you must either discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay valuable gold resources. God cards also depict special abilities that can be activated only if you have previously built a matching statue!<br/><br/>Army cards allow you to send one or more units to conquer villages in nearby regions. You must compete against the other players for control of each region as well as for valuable rewards that can be gained as a result of military conquest.<br/><br/>The position of your High Priest within the Coricancha has a significant impact on your overall strategy, affecting your access to powerful actions and determining any potential resource costs when placing your workers. More specifically, when placing a worker, you must pay additional resources the farther your worker is from your High Priest, from nothing all the way up to eight potatoes or corn!<br/><br/>Additionally, when moving your High Priest, you can activate powerful actions available only within the Coricancha:<br/><br/><br/>     Produce: Gain all rewards from your production buildings.<br/>     Worship: Sacrifice previously sculpted statues to gain permanent temple advancements.<br/>     Offering: Pay resources to gain temple advancements.<br/>     Conquer: Engage in military conquest of nearby villages.<br/>     Rejuvenate: Refresh previously activated buildings and military units.<br/><br/><br/>Throughout the game, you score victory points whenever you construct stairs or sculpt statues. Gain bonus victory points whenever another player makes use of the stairs you have constructed. Score victory points from temple advancements and control of the four regions.<br/><br/>The game ends when the worker pool has become exhausted, symbolizing the full incorporation of nearby regions and villages into the newly risen Inca Empire.

If you make the right choices, you can complete missions to progress to a more advanced era, receiving new interesting options of development and victory points. In the end, the best monarch receives the title of Brazilian Emperor and constructs a new era of prosperity, freedom and peace!<br/><br/>In more detail, while playing in a modular map board that recreate real regions, you use a combination of worker placement, area majority, and individual powers to construct an empire in Brazil between the 16th and 19th centuries. You start by choosing one of the available monarchs and its personal game board and components; some monarchs are strong in combat, while others prioritize science or exploration. You receive tasks that advance you to a new era when you complete them, giving you access to more power constructions as you move into the second and third eras of the game, then you choose a starting point on the shared map.<br/><br/>On each turn, you can participate in an action phase and a movement phase. You manage actions on your individual game board, and you have these seven choices:<br/><br/><br/>    Deploy: Summon one military unit to explore and defend your territory.<br/>    Frame: Buy cards that represent famous historic figures to receive special powers and victory points.<br/>    Build: Construct farms, mines, cities, and other structures to generate resources and do other things.<br/>    Renovate: Overhaul an old building to produce new resources.<br/>    Manufacture: Produce basic resources &mdash; wood, sugar cane, cotton, or coffee &mdash; to receive victory points, improve your &quot;action arches&quot;, and have raw material for more valuable products.<br/>    Harbor: Go to the port to receive a small amount of basic resources.<br/>    Trade: Sell your basic resources to receive gold and special cards to improve your empire.<br/><br/><br/>During the movement phase, you can explore hidden places or attack other players. For combat, you check the power of the troops involved in the conflict to determine the winner, with cards being able to modify these values. Once a player completes their goals in the third era, the game ends and players tally their scores.<br/><br/>Brazil: Imperial was developed with the concept of it being &quot;Euro X&quot;, a new style of game that combines Eurogames (in which you collect and manage resources) and 4x games (in which you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate). A new concept of maps was also introduced in this game. All maps are different and created with modular boards that recreate real regions of Brazil and the world. Each game you can focus on resource management, combat, or a combination of both, depending on your choice of monarch and the interaction with other players.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuiDNcMdWaeDe5_-rISFRQ__thumb/img/Mfht3Q1IcjyVG8A2fdDBP--MWf8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6222695.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuiDNcMdWaeDe5_-rISFRQ__original/img/lLQh6xW5n-SW9LNNMiSloEh3XUM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6222695.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"MeepleBR","designer":"Zé Mendes","artist":"Adalberto Junio, Isaias Junior, Carlos Eduardo Justino, Vinicius Menezes, Arthur Parisi, Girleyne Costa Ramalho, Victor Sales, Ryan Teo, Tom Ventre","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.86937,"avgWeight":3.0367},{"bggId":91080,"name":"Andean Abyss","description":"(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss<br/><br/>Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world&rsquo;s last Marxist guerrilla armies, brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as a state.  A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.<br/><br/>Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.<br/><br/>A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame<br/> From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.

In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.<br/> On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor.

A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.<br/><br/>Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.<br/><br/>Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) <br/>    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) <br/>    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry <br/>    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids<br/>    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French <br/>    French blockades to confound British plans<br/>    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort<br/>    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety <br/>    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. <br/><br/><br/>Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!<br/><br/>As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.<br/><br/>As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?<br/><br/>As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.<br/><br/>As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.  Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available.

Public companies build track and run trains in order to earn revenues. Public company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock.<br/><br/>A feature of 18Chesapeake, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a public company&rsquo;s president and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.<br/><br/>18Chesapeake is a moderate length game.

In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.<br/><br/>The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.<br/><br/>Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!<br/><br/>It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.

The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.<br/><br/>But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.<br/><br/>Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches.

It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is driven by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.<br/><br/>Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.<br/><br/>The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.<br/><br/>From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and different play styles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...<br/><br/>The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest?

The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.<br/><br/>John Company is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.<br/><br/>John Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players.

The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.<br/><br/>The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow.

The fears deep within one&rsquo;s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft&rsquo;s work and the Alien series. In the game, players assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.<br/><br/>Deep Madness is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.<br/><br/>In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.<br/><br/>In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.<br/><br/>Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.<br/><br/>In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.<br/><br/>In each investigator&rsquo;s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness. Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions. Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.<br/><br/>Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.<br/><br/>In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RAaKHdR-UqEN2Xd-j4NhNw__thumb/img/-x1GSZVk9e5bNhrqLYJvdRASZeY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4332309.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RAaKHdR-UqEN2Xd-j4NhNw__original/img/xmqJ2rr8CBgYoLYhWm88e210Bmo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4332309.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Diemension Games","designer":"Chauncey, Roger Ho","artist":"Roberto Chaudon, Joseph Diaz, DRock-ART, Gautier Giroud, Gaël Goumon, Stef Kopinski, Guillem H.

The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?<br/><br/>In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.<br/><br/>Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.<br/><br/>In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.<br/><br/>The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6aRvs9U-vs5r011ThWSQg__thumb/img/fhY4NZvF6g0i5S_9Ee2QNE3aNK0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic106710.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6aRvs9U-vs5r011ThWSQg__original/img/1UamODjYQIylF2f1rfb2QJejsnc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic106710.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Derek Carver, Pierre Cléquin, Bruno Faidutti, Corey Konieczka","artist":"John Gravato, Tomasz Jedruszek, Robert Lazzaretti, Francis Tsai","honors":"2006 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee","bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3,6],"avgRating":6.86844,"avgWeight":3.5019},{"bggId":75165,"name":"De Vulgari Eloquentia","description":"Italy, late Middle Ages. The fabric merchants need to write down their contracts in a language that everyone can understand and the literates are looking for an alternative to the elite of the traditional Latin language. So, the Volgare, the language spoken by the common people, taken from the dialects spoken in the various Italian regions, starts to gain relevance. During this period, Francesco D&rsquo;Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare.<br/><br/>The players will have to do their part in the creation of this new language! But who will provide them the proper knowledge to understand the manuscripts in the different dialects? Who will succeed to uncover the secrets of the books inside the Papal Library? Who will embrace the religious life and who will remain a merchant? Some of the players can become a famous banker, someone else can climb the church&rsquo;s hierarchy to be the next Pope! But in the end, who will be the most appreciated and respected for his status and his culture?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to obtain more Volgare points. The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &quot;The Riddle from Verona&quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope. Moreover, VP can be gotten with money and with the support of Politicians, Noblemen, Abbesses, and the Amanuensis.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mAyx-NXFYvTj6Dz-YKormQ__thumb/img/k56Pz_BhVJ2ojAzx9Z5BeZth3pQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic778029.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mAyx-NXFYvTj6Dz-YKormQ__original/img/Ch4TL5VvsCZGDrEfAvpA65Drym8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic778029.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Giochix.it","designer":"Mario Papini","artist":"Lamberto Azzariti, Guido Favaro, Eva Villa","honors":"2011 JoTa Best Heavy Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.21728,"avgWeight":3.6238},{"bggId":272682,"name":"Expedition to Newdale","description":"Expedition to Newdale is the new Oh my Goods! game from renowned designer Alexander Pfister. In this board game adaption of the successful card game, 1 to 4 players from 12 and up compete in different chapters to experience the world of the Longsdale kingdom once again. The story of Expedition to Newdale starts about five years after the events from Oh my Goods! Escape to Canyon Brook, but you don&rsquo;t need to know the prequels at all. Each chapter of the game lasts about 90 minutes which adds up to around 12 hours of exciting campaign gameplay. And when you found your favorite chapter while playing the campaign, you can always come back and play it again to have even more fun!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you have your personal board, a coal mine as your start building and 5 hand cards. Depending on which chapter you are playing, the appropriate game board sits in the middle of the table. Each round is divided into 5 phases which are played in order (or partially parallel, once you become more familiar with the game). In phase 1, a new event is revealed which usually alters the course of play in this round slightly (e. g., by introducing new buildings). Additionally the event card shows a fixed amount of workers which are available this round. An information which is much appreciated, as you have to place your action markers in phase 2. The latter are numbered 1 &mdash; 4 which is important for phase 4 and means that you need to plan ahead. But first phase 3: in this phase, more workers are drawn from a bag and get added to the others. This means that productions which would have been impossible before (because workers were missing) are now easily done. Pushing your luck might be beneficial! Phase 4 is the opposite to phase 2. Instead of placing your workers, you resolve their chosen action in order of their numbers. We hope you had a backup plan in place if your desired workers were not drawn in phase 3, because this can trigger an unpleasant chain of events! Not enough workers could mean that a production does not happen, which then means that you might not have enough money to build the building with your second action marker. Oh, and your third marker was planned to directly produce in the newly built building? Well, where there is no building, there&rsquo;s no place to produce in, right? Clearly: planning ahead, a little luck and good alternatives are the way to success. In Phase 5, all players can either use a free building action or draw new hand cards. The last phase is used to resolve all buildings which do not need workers, e. g., an automatic coal production or a building which offers the conversion of a certain good to victory points. Afterwards the next round starts, of which you play a total of seven. A final scoring at the end of round seven will then show if you win or lose.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qpGBNV1z2RR8Ed0913Rwlg__thumb/img/1nOwLKOvK_gdpeqjzR7vAoCmy8A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4956399.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qpGBNV1z2RR8Ed0913Rwlg__original/img/3iLwwm5CPojuXw_1UZBDUqzaUw8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4956399.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Lookout Games","designer":"Alexander Pfister","artist":"Klemens Franz","honors":"2019 Meeples' Choice Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.43851,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":146910,"name":"Wildcatters","description":"Wildcatters is a tactical and strategic board game set during the booming business of the 19th century oil industry!<br/><br/>The players are oil barons who develop oil fields; bid for oil rights; and build rigs, oil tankers, trains, and refineries.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.<br/>To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.<br/><br/>As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.<br/><br/>MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.<br/>The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.<br/><br/>Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant.

Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics.  Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts.

Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r0rOK-QZI1IiUUAYKFkN2g__thumb/img/x9-xbFvex5pQZW0D5PjG2DBRUV8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic577593.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r0rOK-QZI1IiUUAYKFkN2g__original/img/CH3jNB79mo6itDcS23s4LKmxT-s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic577593.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"999 Games","designer":"Peter Hawes","artist":"Mike Jackson, Ben Nelson","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.36076,"avgWeight":3.1988},{"bggId":226501,"name":"Dragonfire","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Dragonfire is a cooperative deck-building game set within the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

Pendragon &ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.<br/><br/>Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:<br/><br/>Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens.<br/>Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.<br/>Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.<br/>Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ.<br/>Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics.<br/>Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control.<br/>Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation.<br/>Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes.<br/>Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.<br/>Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms.<br/>A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.<br/>Short, medium, and full-length scenarios<br/>Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.<br/><br/>Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.<br/><br/>The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&mdash;materially or culturally&mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.<br/><br/>The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&mdash;whoever their paymaster&mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.<br/><br/>The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority.

You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.<br/><br/>The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.<br/><br/>After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.<br/><br/>It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want).

Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn.

It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre! Balance gold and food, war and agriculture, territory and technology to forge an empire that is destined to rise above all other nations!<br/><br/>Each copy of Rise of Empires contains:<br/>. 1 large game board<br/>. 1 tiles display<br/>. 40 resource discs<br/>. 150 player cubes in 5 colors<br/>. 45 action discs in 5 colors<br/>. 8 empire tiles<br/>. 40 territory tiles<br/>. 48 progress tiles<br/>. 36 city tiles<br/>. 104 gold markers<br/>. 5 alliance pieces<br/>. 5 player aid cards<br/>. 1 rules booklet with illustrated example of play.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ckbYcn2XmNr5GN1imz0XdA__thumb/img/qK_aVFUIzj0juV0MVIj1YB63Jgk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic434539.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ckbYcn2XmNr5GN1imz0XdA__original/img/WI-CiY2TAMspUBBADn8J86OZFbY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic434539.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"Phalanx Games B.V.","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Czarnè","honors":"2009 Jogo do Ano Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.03488,"avgWeight":3.5491},{"bggId":17223,"name":"World of Warcraft: The Boardgame","description":"Take on the role of a chivalrous paladin or a wise shaman, a holy priest or a vile warlock, a mighty mage or a crafty rogue.

Beyond these basics, 1817 introduces several additional financial mechanics such as short selling, market driven interest rates, hostile takeovers, and corporate liquidations. The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don&rsquo;t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date. You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase. Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase.

The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance. The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists &ndash; they become possessed by the lust for making this world better. They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their &ndash; great, according to them &ndash; ideas.<br/><br/>Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth &mdash; or as a last resort make them vanish. Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?<br/><br/>From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.<br/><br/><br/>    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them. She needs to isolate two of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Pier van Dyken &ndash; greedy collector of M-factor. When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn. He needs to absorb four magical reserves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Ulrike Freihoff &ndash; spreads her religion. When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.<br/><br/><br/>There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.<br/><br/>The game may end in one of the three ways:<br/><br/>    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,<br/>    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,<br/>    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.<br/><br/><br/>INITIATIVE PHASE:<br/>During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.<br/><br/>PLANNING PHASE:<br/>Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.<br/><br/>ACTION PHASE:<br/>Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.<br/>&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.<br/>&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence<br/>&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)<br/>&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region<br/>&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.<br/>&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.<br/>&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.<br/>&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.<br/><br/>DOMINATION PHASE:<br/>Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gn1YR96qXoUhVSbo4SKwvQ__thumb/img/JL4Q92Z4rHdKr7s1i5MTj5SKcf0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2003559.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gn1YR96qXoUhVSbo4SKwvQ__original/img/KZ962YXiZaoLSP47ySmBsM9jerE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2003559.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Giochix.it","designer":"Krzysztof Wolicki","artist":"Dominik Kasprzycki","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.64488,"avgWeight":4.0763},{"bggId":26457,"name":"Successors (Third Edition)","description":"When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered. It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms. Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.<br/><br/>Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.<br/><br/>In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved. Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules. The rules also include hints on strategy from a number of long-time Successors players, and an extended example of play.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ViFg7QgQXnbHVSPCrXM-Q__thumb/img/WsgSBhsfNvsetJwbFjexQtOp43Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic373193.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ViFg7QgQXnbHVSPCrXM-Q__original/img/_X59kQT51kdYEkXNe2qRIapJ5NY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic373193.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Richard H.

Its profits catapulted the British Empire to global dominance and shaped the fate of some of the world's great nations, but its ascent was anything but easy. The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.<br/><br/>John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company's history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: Use the Company and the Company's trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end, you guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region's infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...<br/><br/>As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It's even possible that the Company's trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms.

Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.<br/><br/>Braking sections have a particular feature: here players and robots can try late braking, a dangerous maneuver that allows them to overtake multiple cars simultaneously. Other maneuvers or cards require a &quot;check&quot;, e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target.<br/><br/>Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.<br/><br/>Race! is a board game with no dice in which strategy and risk melt together to convey a truly intense and deep racing experience.

The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.<br/><br/>Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.<br/><br/>In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.<br/><br/>The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDu-gDsxSSL49NPK7tfipg__thumb/img/9N_wI7AtLR1qsSEq2MZI18nAA9Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic322925.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDu-gDsxSSL49NPK7tfipg__original/img/3q8CAGuSM98IZ1p4bfAtF2tIx9s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic322925.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1996,"publisher":"Descartes Editeur","designer":"Dominique Ehrhard, Duccio Vitale","artist":"Dominique Ehrhard, Guillaume Rohmer, Duccio Vitale","honors":"1996/Fall Lucca Games Best Original Game","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.86324,"avgWeight":3.0391},{"bggId":316786,"name":"Tabannusi: Builders of Ur","description":"Set in ancient Mesopotamia, a cradle of civilization, at a time when the location of Ur was a coastal region, players work to build the Great City of Ur, expand its districts, and establish themselves as powerful builders.<br/><br/>Tabannusi: Builders of Ur features a stunning board showing the city of Ur divided into 5 regions, each tied to a specific color die.

Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).<br/><br/>Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.<br/><br/>The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.<br/><br/>There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.<br/><br/>As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.  The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game, i.e., the player with the most valuable combination of Industries and money, is the winner.<br/><br/>How will you build your Nation?<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WaNNARA1fokZ5WOGB2Gfbg__thumb/img/rknao-P-3kZxIwYVnzuIncUgozk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic349489.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WaNNARA1fokZ5WOGB2Gfbg__original/img/Xx4-XNJd0-znbpMgTqK_n12fMUA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic349489.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"TableStar Games","designer":"Nico Carroll","artist":"Gregor Benedetti","honors":"2009 JoTa Best Heavy Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":6.92734,"avgWeight":3.6068},{"bggId":424,"name":"1870: Railroading across the Trans Mississippi from 1870","description":"This 18xx game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements.

Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!<br/><br/>Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader. While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor. Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.  Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace.<br/><br/>Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.  Each round begins with the marketplace phase. Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.  Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.  Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.  Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.  An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.  After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income.  Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents.  The price for placing agents depends on the location.  Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.<br/><br/>Each round concludes with selling phase.  Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village.  Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game.  Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house. Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in. Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round. End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9X8h1wU5gHxLq1EfYZI_5A__thumb/img/fjy1iIepXtAjmizISJYF82a0HYc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic143036.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9X8h1wU5gHxLq1EfYZI_5A__original/img/yWodKi08c7Cz3m3AyxWaIYZXvAY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic143036.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Mind the Move","designer":"Emanuele Ornella","artist":"Czarnè","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.89726,"avgWeight":3.176},{"bggId":71906,"name":"Castaways","description":"You've been shipwrecked on a deserted isle.

At the start of play, you receive a number of Province cards at random, then mark your initial positions with town pieces. Shuffle these Province cards with a set of five Initial cards to form your starting deck, then draw a hand of five cards. The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game.<br/><br/>Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card. The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels. Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads. As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play.<br/><br/>On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards. Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province. To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses.<br/><br/>Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards. Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource. You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve. You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces. Castles increase the defensive value of a province.<br/><br/>All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province. Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card. For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the &quot;Roadside Inns&quot; VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP. You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters. The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pk-IBl84HBPZWZQgQWkCpQ__thumb/img/a3sfzRClZ7sfj4Jyq6SJ8TdCQto=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2257592.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pk-IBl84HBPZWZQgQWkCpQ__original/img/u22VUm-pgFA90Qppcc-XOJGeYvU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2257592.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Treefrog Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Sanjana Baijnath","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.81507,"avgWeight":3.0882},{"bggId":12166,"name":"Funkenschlag","description":"Players draw electrical networks on the board connecting various cities and then power them by purchasing power plants and the resources to run the plants.<br/><br/>This is the first edition of the game, published only by 2F Spiele.

It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.<br/><br/>TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame, that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.<br/><br/>THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.<br/><br/>THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.<br/><br/>THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.<br/><br/>THE KAMPFGRUPPE 03 are the heirs to the Order of Marduk - and same as their spiritual ancestors in medieval times, dragonslayers Siegfried and Georg, they strive for a world unburdened by TSUKUYUMI'S existence.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win. <br/> After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.<br/><br/>According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.<br/>Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase.

Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board.  One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.<br/><br/>Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.<br/><br/>There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.<br/><br/>When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.<br/><br/>When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.<br/><br/>Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).<br/><br/>Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.<br/><br/>One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z0XUOK08tRPSL9t6AypO2w__thumb/img/FSjEPxttSY8rvIxQzj6Th8cwrfM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic217481.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z0XUOK08tRPSL9t6AypO2w__original/img/WZJ-BnYBnbQ-05mKnPD8tFiOSDE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic217481.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"R&D Games","designer":"Richard Breese","artist":"Juliet Breese, Mike Doyle (I)","honors":"2009 Games Magazine Best New Advanced Strategy Game Winner","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":6.72131,"avgWeight":3.0209},{"bggId":220588,"name":"Gandhi: The Decolonization of British India, 1917 – 1947","description":"Gandhi: The Decolonization of British India, 1917&ndash;1947 is Volume IX in GMT&rsquo;s acclaimed COIN Series.

COIN veterans will be able to jump right in.<br/><br/>Other features include:<br/><br/>     Gandhi as the game&rsquo;s sole leader piece.<br/>     Nonviolent operations and special activities.<br/>     Nonviolent activists that are always active, but generally immune from Raj actions until engaged in protests (or caught up in post-terror reprisals).<br/>     Protests that erode support but leave activists vulnerable to arrest by Raj forces.<br/>     A Hindu-Muslim Unity track that measures tensions between these two communities, affecting resources, operations, and victory.<br/>     A British Rule track that reflects shifts in colonial policy in response to events on the map, from resolve to restraint, affecting the cost of several actions.<br/>     British Viceroys who come and go with each passing campaign and have their own unique effects on each faction.<br/>     An out-of-play jail space that holds nonviolent forces arrested during martial law.

However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).<br/><br/>With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tj4tIPBtdLy1_7N6O4pDoQ__thumb/img/RChOf469MwxQ5-L-CMOx40QqEvo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic910745.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tj4tIPBtdLy1_7N6O4pDoQ__original/img/UHjNtwcGlgL4VOSt48r2ndHVuSU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic910745.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Argentum Verlag","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Dennis Lohausen","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.05107,"avgWeight":3.1758},{"bggId":200890,"name":"Pixie Queen","description":"Pixie Queen is a smoothly playing worker-placement game about a pixie queen who rules over her subordinates like a true tyrant.

The aim of the game is to move stone, cheese, and passengers from the Dales to the major trunk routes served by the North Eastern Railway and the Midland Railway.<br/><br/>Valleys play a large part in dictating where you can build track. Once you have built a line you must acquire second hand engines and rolling stock to move the goods and passengers that your line connects to. Such a line quickly becomes unprofitable and it pays to have one of the two major companies take it over from you.<br/><br/>Building track can also be made more difficult by local residents who object to railways being built on their land. To overcome such opposition you require influence in government to arrange the necessary compulsory purchase orders.<br/><br/>Description of the game, from the backside of the box:<br/>For many years the train gaming world has been waiting for a game about moving cheese in the Yorkshire Dales. That wait is now over!<br/>As the director of a small railway company who has inveigled investment money from gullible locals, it's up to you to see if you can actually make a profit from building track amongst some of the most difficult terrain in England. There's stone to be moved from quarries, and cheese to be moved to market. You might also find the odd passenger who wants to travel to civilization.<br/><br/>However, standing in your way is the local farmer, who really does not want you to build on his land. Fortunately you can buy favours from the necessary government committee to deal with such irritations. You will also need a few contacts with other train companies, as you will need their second-hand engines to run on your lines. Finally, once you've sucked all the profit that you can from a route, you must off-load it to a major train company before you are saddled with the losses.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JHfw-nac9A0sfkNJGxDOYQ__thumb/img/E2ghzjuIWJKZMg6Y-dXb8lg3eKs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic501286.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JHfw-nac9A0sfkNJGxDOYQ__original/img/sRV2vWkCXpLOf3NaXG1ROdbyc54=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic501286.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"Treefrog Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Mike Atkinson","honors":"2009 Jogo do Ano Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":7.08499,"avgWeight":3.2581},{"bggId":73070,"name":"Olympus","description":"In the Ancient Greece, the poleis (city-states) thrived increasing their population and culture, occasionally waging war against each other, erecting buildings and celebrating ceremonies to get the favour of the deities abiding on Mount Olympus. The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!<br/><br/>Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).<br/><br/>Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.<br/><br/>Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).<br/><br/>The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.<br/><br/>All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &quot;do you develop your grain productivity &ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).<br/><br/>When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).<br/><br/>Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_JBSpZ1lj4jyD-RY1-mJw__thumb/img/yLElRHA-YOI2yX0o4kX7UfS4fAo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1280009.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_JBSpZ1lj4jyD-RY1-mJw__original/img/r_ZN5PTjX8inkciH6NH1Za9jvRw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1280009.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Stratelibri","designer":"Andrea Chiarvesio, Luca Iennaco","artist":"Antonio Dessi","honors":"2010 Lucca Games Best Boardgame","bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.81066,"avgWeight":3.009},{"bggId":1044,"name":"Gunslinger","description":"&quot;Fill Yore Hand ...&quot; with Gunslinger, the game of western gunfights. In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.<br/><br/>Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.<br/><br/>Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.<br/><br/>Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.

Communist movements have sprung up throughout Europe. Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin plan to blast through Poland in order to support the red revolutions in Germany, France and England. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Strike of the Eagle models the battles and historical events of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.<br/><br/>To simulate the tension of the era from the fog of war, players alternate placing secret orders on their armies in order to bluff, mislead and misdirect their opponents. These concealed orders make it difficult to deduce an opponent's plans and are used to hide a player's true intentions and objectives. Players then reveal and resolve the issued orders. They can then disrupt their opponent's moves, cut off supply and much more. Once orders are resolved the next turn begins.<br/><br/>Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, but with a simple and quick combat system.<br/><br/>Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle's resolution.[...]<br/><br/>Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.<br/><br/>The map portrays a portion of Eastern Europe in 1920. It is divided into areas that are named after local cities to simplify scenario setups. Along the outer edge of the map is a grid to help find areas during game setup. Each area name is followed by its grid location.<br/>The map is divided into two fronts; the northern and the southern. The front line is designated by a yellow line that runs from east to west. In 4 player scenarios, each allied player commands blocks on one front only. If a block of one player crosses the line between fronts, it moves to the control of his ally at the beginning of the next Operation Phase.<br/><br/>The Fog of War series is a card driven game where Divisions and Brigades are represented as blocks. These blocks stand upright during the game to prevent opponents from knowing their strength or unit type and can only be revealed during combat or through Recon Area orders given during each Operation Phase.<br/><br/>Strike of the Eagle is divided into a number of Rounds, each Round being subdivided into a number of identical phases. The Round Phase Track marks the game's progression. Each round is divided into the Replenish Cards Phase, five identical Operation Phases, and a Reinforcement Phase.<br/>Each side has a pool of order counters to draw from. These order counters represent the various types of orders each unit or group may be given. These orders, which range from Forced Marches to Reconnaissance actions, allow the player to strategically manouver his Divisions and Brigades. Orders are placed face down, leading to guesswork and strategic anticipation on the part of your opponent!<br/><br/>The sequence of placing and executing orders is determined by the player(s) with the higher initiative. Each front has its own initiative track. Initiative is gained and lost as the game progresses. Whether to place first or second is an important strategic element of the game!<br/><br/>Strike of the Eagle is a card driven game. Each card is broken up into a number of different parts and each card can be played for either its event as listed in the body of the card, to increase the number of orders available in a phase (uppermost left), for the combat value on the card (uppermost right), or for reinforcements (lowermost left).<br/><br/>Supply is important in Stike of the Eagle. If units are out of supply they will fight less well, take much greater losses, and lose the advantage of any Garrison which might be located at their city.<br/><br/>(from Academy Games website)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C7pFct-PVrGWJIQ72gnNCA__thumb/img/8F34DR-g2dNPVFVrMqKsMQ7aFpY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic967310.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C7pFct-PVrGWJIQ72gnNCA__original/img/pciahlIFoNZ5bDmnxxrOK6xElbk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic967310.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2011,"publisher":"Academy Games, Inc.","designer":"Brian Bennett, Uwe Eickert, Robert Żak","artist":"Jarek Nocoń, Steve Paschal","honors":"2011 Charles S.

You will try to achieve influence and prestige for your family. You will grow your family's estate, earn the queen's favor, bear witness to scandalous behavior, gain influence with the church, bribe royalty, and leverage your political weight during masquerade balls, all in an effort to ensure your family's rightful place in history.

The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.<br/><br/>Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.<br/><br/>After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.<br/><br/>Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.<br/><br/>David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.  But for those looking for a challenging medieval resource management/economic engine game, here you are.&rsquo;<br/><br/>The game is for two to four players, with a game time of approximately 30 minutes plus 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Key Market was released at the Essen Spiel in October 2010 as a limited edition of 900 copies.

Howard (creator of Conan), Solomon Kane is a narrative adventure board game featuring exceptional 35mm miniatures. It is a highly innovative co-operative game of storytelling, resource management, and tactical miniatures play. Players take the part of the invisible powers of good and light who aid Solomon Kane in his quest to overcome the forces of Darkness. Each player is one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with special powers that reflect their unique role.<br/><br/>Drawing upon Howard&rsquo;s famous tales of the Puritan avenger, the core box allows players to tell their own versions of the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, and Blue Flame of Vengeance. Expansions recreate Howard&rsquo;s other Solomon Kane stories, as well as adding original adventures for the hero, created especially for the game.<br/><br/>In Solomon Kane, each of Howard&rsquo;s tales is told as one or more Acts, with each Act comprising a full game session. Shorter stories like Rattle of Bones can be completed in a single session, whilst longer tales will take multiple sessions to play through.<br/><br/>An Act is broken down into 8-10 Chapters, and each Chapter has multiple possible outcomes depending upon the actions of the players. Some Chapters offer story choices, whereas others see the action play out on the game board as the players work together to aid Solomon Kane in his quest.<br/><br/>Using custom card decks and dice, each Virtue can control Solomon Kane or his allies, moving them around the board, fighting enemies, exploring locations, and interrogating suspects for information. If the odds get too stacked against Solomon Kane, the Virtues can even manifest directly to intervene on the board.<br/><br/>Opposing Solomon Kane and the players is the Darkness. This twisted reflection of the Virtues is controlled by an AI deck which determines the actions of enemy miniatures, thwarts the player&rsquo;s best plans, and competes with them to drive the story in an evil and unholy direction.<br/><br/>The world of Solomon Kane is brought to life through the stunning artistic vision of Guillem H. Pongiluppi and game designer Jake Thornton, whose &lsquo;puppet master&rsquo; game mechanics break new ground in co-operative gameplay. With multiple versions of every single Chapter, Solomon Kane is able to combine immersive storytelling with abundant replayability for a truly unique gameplay experience.<br/><br/>Who is Solomon Kane?<br/>Solomon Kane is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs. He roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest.<br/><br/>All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa &ndash; even to the shores of the distant New World of America. He neither knows nor questions why is driven to do this. It simply must be done.<br/><br/>To Solomon Kane he is the fulfiller of God&rsquo;s judgment; a vessel of wrath to be emptied onto the souls of the unrighteous. To his enemies he is an implacable fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R9D3SS_Dehl1JR2hspQT_w__thumb/img/zIVxvqbY8enxz6tf4-4O0Kx6scY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4235874.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R9D3SS_Dehl1JR2hspQT_w__original/img/IN_UUzAdDYNBhy4S3nENyW-SJvU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4235874.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Mythic Games","designer":"Jake Thornton","artist":"Thierry Masson, Guillem H.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.<br/><br/>In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.<br/><br/>Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.<br/><br/>When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.<br/><br/>Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.<br/><br/>NOTE: this description is out-of-date.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dE3dzjw1XEQ4cOZ33heWiw__thumb/img/9pSTauTiI8Sf_0gWIoF0VGljA3M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2721731.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dE3dzjw1XEQ4cOZ33heWiw__original/img/TD3J09ukjPIjF1adqSkALaivkbE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2721731.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Treefrog Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Peter Dennis","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.84734,"avgWeight":3.527},{"bggId":17393,"name":"Pax Romana","description":"How did Rome get to be Rome?

Each player controls a different cube-shaped character miniature and player board.  You then assign a different movement skill to five of the six sides of your character (the sixth side has an ability unique to your character). When you begin the movement phase on your turn you &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; your character into an adjacent space and perform the movement skill associated with the face-up side of your character. Skills include: Tumble, Jump, Slide, Diagonal Slide, and Dash.<br/><br/>While you work to complete the scenario&rsquo;s objective(s), either on your own, cooperatively, or against other players, game boards which are laid out in grids present obstacles like walls, raging rivers, chasms, moving platforms, rotating board sections, trap doors, tunnels, teleporters and more. As you navigate the world you create new obstacles and shortcuts while battling your opponents by pushing them into pits, blocking their paths and fouling their plans.<br/><br/>As you explore the world you will find food, runes, items and pets in the form of cards.

As the new game changes the map of the original, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.<br/><br/>M&eacute;gawatts is the French release of the Friedemann Friese game Power Grid. The French edition is produced by Filosofia.<br/><br/>As with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>It differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.<br/><br/>The Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.<br/><br/>The ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.<br/><br/> Re-Implements: <br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid<br/>     Funkenschlag<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid: France/Italy<br/>     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe<br/>     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)<br/>     Power Grid: The New Power Plant Cards<br/>     Power Grid: China/Korea<br/>     Power Grid: Flux Generator<br/><br/><br/>The expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards.

It is as close and yet far from Chinese Mahjong as Sh&ocirc;gi (Japanese Chess) can be the same and yet different from original Chess. Mahjong was brought to Japan in 1904, but the Riichi form that is used in modern times probably originated from the 1920s. Today, the worldwide famous Mahjong Association officially recognized the complete rules of Riichi Mahjong for Tournaments.<br/><br/>The main differences are :<br/>1) The 1-Yaku minimum: In order to win a hand, it can only be validated when your hand has at least one of the Yaku (specific hand combinations) in it.<br/>2) Dora: A specific bonus tiles are indicated by the flipped tile from the dead wall and providing other possible Han bonus.<br/>3) Riichi: When a player is Tenpai (one tile away from having a Mahjong hand, valid or not), he can bet a 1000 points chip to add one Yaku to his hand (thus validating a possible invalid hand).  Winning with a Riichi hand allows access to the hidden ura-dora, which is an added dora indicator located underneath the revealed dora tile.<br/>4) Abortive draws: Specific conditions, which ends a hand without winning prior to the drawing of all tiles, aside from the dead wall.<br/>5) Scoring system: Much more complex than in Chinese Mahjong, it is based on hand combinations (Yaku) providing multipliers (Han) that combine with some other circumstantial points like the type of tiles in the hand (Fu) for any 4 han or less.  The combination of Han and Fu correspond to a chart (and even an equation) to finally produce the hand's scoring points (Ten).<br/><br/>Some other minor elements in the Riichi Mahjong differ from the original Mahjong but are not important enough to be fully mentioned, like the Red 5 tiles (a non-official variant sometimes used which gives bonus like the Dora) or the validation of some Yaku (when the hand must be kept hidden or not, depending on the Japanese region where the game is played).<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/62j0mEWiwuyZixScOzwEnA__thumb/img/momsWLUZJUTVdxpNbJaCqu-Rxak=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4667546.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/62j0mEWiwuyZixScOzwEnA__original/img/sx6PwhoQPB7ltdxFhtK42Gzq9tE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4667546.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":0,"publisher":"(Public Domain)","designer":"(Uncredited)","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":8.27185,"avgWeight":3.5172},{"bggId":15369,"name":"The Devil's Cauldron: The Battles for Arnhem and Nijmegen","description":"&quot;Devil's Cauldron&quot; is a company level simulation of the Northern two drop zones in Operation Market Garden.

Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.<br/><br/>The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold.

If you switch, you&rsquo;ll flip over all of your accumulated game components, watching your crew grow into new roles with new art for the same characters, while finding entirely new uses for your ocean tiles and resources, and beginning to trade with the &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; players as you go after new objectives. As players turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; different niches are filled, forever changing the game&rsquo;s economy. Mastering this ebb and flow will be critical if you&rsquo;re to shape the new face of humanity!<br/><br/>As a &ldquo;Sinksider,&rdquo; you will explore the ocean with your skiffs, pulling some of the 92 hexagon-shaped ocean tiles out of a bag, and arranging them to help you effectively collect resources, discover valuable artifacts from the sunken civilization, all while trying to avoid toxic radiation left from the disaster. You&rsquo;ll dive for supplies, rolling a pool of custom dive dice that vary based on the depth level of your skiffs. You&rsquo;ll also carefully manage your resources, trading them on the open market for the currency you can use to buy more skiffs and outposts, or stockpiling them for when you turn &ldquo;Skyside.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As a &ldquo;Skysider,&rdquo; you will use your resources to build an expansive network of watercraft and docks, using the &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; of your ocean tiles. Your divers will also have new jobs as researchers, rolling custom, multicolor Research dice, to discover new technologies that allow the Flotilla to manage a growing population. You&rsquo;ll also build Sonar stations, making life a little easier for the &ldquo;Sinksiders&rdquo; still out exploring the unknown, while earning quite a few points for yourself.<br/><br/>On both sides, you&rsquo;ll also grow your relationships with the four different governing guilds, each giving you unique bonuses and more powerful crew. The players with the strongest relationships will also earn valuable points at the end of the game!<br/><br/>The components in Flotilla are unique, immersive, and interconnected. Your skiffs will be able to actually carry up to four resource barrels, and come in a unique shape for each player color. Artifact tokens slot into matching spaces in a double-layered hub board and art on the ocean tiles lines up to create a unique layout for your growing Flotilla each time you play.<br/><br/>In Flotilla, you&rsquo;ll find significant strategic depth and variety, while giving players the freedom to tell their own story. Will you build the Flotilla by being the first to go Skyside, or stay Sinkside for the whole game, becoming the most powerful seafarer of them all?<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ldSFIyYArYU_iXHRnOF7iA__thumb/img/Uuhmrda91vHNrI0qVMZCEw6c5eQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4653762.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ldSFIyYArYU_iXHRnOF7iA__original/img/xCC6KPlFqBps5Z9UJuIJfZaWE74=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4653762.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"WizKids (I)","designer":"J.B.

The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.<br/><br/>Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

You acquire reputation mostly through fulfilling objectives, taking control of one or more of the eight commanders, and building transmitter stations. The flow of the game is controlled by an action board with two action panels, each of which has five columns. At the start of each round, there are a 3-5 action tokens (crew members) standing in each column on the upper action panel. To carry out an action, a player:<br/><br/>A) takes an action token from the upper panel and places it on the lower action panel either to gain resources or to pay for a movement on the planet surface, or<br/> B) pays for every action token still standing in a certain column on the upper panel to gain control over the commander and his ability at the top of that panel, after which the player places those action tokens on the lower panel.<br/><br/>Since option A) will reduce the cost for option B), the players have to find the right timing for their actions.

Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.<br/><br/>A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.<br/><br/>Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.<br/><br/>Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.<br/><br/>Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-GHaejCSEWT_98OMpQS-Sw__thumb/img/8LjlxqNJ-oVFNvv8pzbtrB27paQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1721040.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-GHaejCSEWT_98OMpQS-Sw__original/img/9uEJbs0de7x_3cTCmJWpuY9sOdA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1721040.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"MegaCon Games","designer":"Brian Shotton, Kenny Sims","artist":"Keith Lowe","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":6.57323,"avgWeight":3.8264},{"bggId":149119,"name":"Spirits of the Rice Paddy","description":"Ancient Balinese legend describes a host of powerful spirits who help poor rice farmers achieve success.

The game proceeds simultaneously over three different periods. You start the game in the Middle Ages, on the first of the three game boards (that of the commanderies). With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys&hellip;).<br/><br/>Thanks to the watch makers' invention, and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time&hellip; Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential, since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.<br/><br/>Playing with time is not without consequences, and it can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board&hellip; The abbey finally never existed!<br/><br/>On the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board. On the the commanderies board, a player who controls a domain militarily, i.e. the one with the biggest military building, will receive the value of the civil buildings in this domain in profits. On the priories board, it is the religious control that will be taken into account. On the brotherhoods board, the players who have best populated the civil buildings and restored the ruins will secure the best profits.<br/><br/>The possibility of destroying and regrouping buildings to unite or divide domains provides a strong and permanent level of interaction between the players.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/38UliyiXQuYP7YuBxy-YtQ__thumb/img/Aoj7lu1JtC-aYOSFUb9vRCmtAAM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1195438.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/38UliyiXQuYP7YuBxy-YtQ__original/img/N2pJhMfX8OdoMvOkBw_jN2qMbA8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1195438.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Matagot","designer":"Arnaud Urbon, Ludovic Vialla","artist":"Jean-Claude Adelmand, Geoffrey Stepourenko","honors":"2008 Games Magazine Best New Advanced Strategy Game Winner","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.32233,"avgWeight":3.5596},{"bggId":300664,"name":"Arkwright: The Card Game","description":"In the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution starts. The first factories were founded by businessmen like Richard Arkwright, who ran the first factory for spinning wool with machines like the &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot; and the water frame.<br/><br/>In &quot;Arkwright: The Card Game&quot;, you run a business and will employ workers in your different factories to produce and sell goods. The more workers, the more goods that can be sold &mdash; but be prepared for crises and some stiff competition.<br/><br/>The game is played over three decades (1770/1780/1790), split up into four rounds per decade. On your turn, you play new cards from your hand to open factories and upgrade existing ones, select improvements, improve factory quality, build machines, and employ new workers. You can also pay money to improve your shareholdings, and take out loans if you require more money for production costs. After the actions phase, you can improve your abilities by advancing your development markers on your player board, or take one of the available development cards.<br/><br/>Then, the production phase starts, where every player who owns a factory of the current good produces those goods. The market fluctuates with the general demand, so the demand may be lower than the value of your current good, lowering your profit. Workers must be paid, and machines need regular maintenance, so you can possibly lose money instead of turning a profit. Selling enough of one good improves your share value, and there are bonuses for having the highest appeal. Lastly, if you can&rsquo;t sell your goods to the home market, you can ship them overseas or store them for future rounds.<br/><br/>After the final round of the last decade, the game ends. Players then sell all goods left in their storehouses, reduce the number of shares they hold by the number of loans they took, and reduce their share value based on their personal shipping track. Each player then multiplies the number of their shares by their share value to determine their end score.

The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering &quot;mythic&quot; feel to it rather than a &ldquo;fantasy adventure&rdquo; sensation.<br/><br/>Glorantha: The Gods War is based on the vigorous mythic realm of Glorantha, which has been the basis for multiple tabletop board, roleplaying, and even digital games, as well as numerous works of fiction. Its depth and scope has been recognized by numerous aficionados of fantasy and gaming, and now it is brought to you in all its astounding power.<br/><br/>In each round, in the Action Phase players spend the power they have earned from various sources, most importantly how many different types of buildings they have and the Heroquests they have achieved. They then spend power to build more buildings, summon and move units, do battle with enemy empires, and use powerful empire-specific abilities including from their earned gifts. The Council Phase may include an attempt to close the Chaos Rift that threatens the existence of the world and/or the Great Compromise in which an empire may sacrifice power for the greater good and to distribute victory points.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by obtaining victory points from various sources, most importantly the number of buildings controlled each round, paired Heroquests achieved and the Great Compromise, and from runes.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HMT9UXpcv3rA7TOVW9390w__thumb/img/dov-SelIV6KDNdWF_T2KksyIEuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4211206.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HMT9UXpcv3rA7TOVW9390w__original/img/mvdLYJBQA9W8gjf302EEvQwEPz8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4211206.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Petersen Games","designer":"Sandy Petersen","artist":"Rich Fleider","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,null],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":7.9332,"avgWeight":3.4091},{"bggId":139562,"name":"Rockwell","description":"Each player represents a mining company drilling the Earth to get resources.

The Saxon Lords must use the city's meager starting resources to build up the 25 districts of Canterbury and provide key services to its citizens.<br/><br/>The key services are (in order from most basic to most prestigious) water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture. These services are provided by structures that are built in the various districts. However, structures that provide higher end services can only be built if the more basic services are already present in that district. For example, a Saxon Lord cannot order the construction of a chapel (which provides religion) unless there is already water and food in that district.<br/><br/>As new structures are built in the city, the city grows more prosperous. While each Saxon Lord jealously guards his or her own prosperity and achievements, they all benefit as a whole from the growing prosperity of the city itself. The city treasury grows as the city prospers, and the Saxon Lords must balance their publicly scrutinized withdrawals from the treasury with the ambition of their building projects.

Over the following centuries, Europe was taken over. In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H&auml;ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.<br/><br/>Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.<br/><br/>In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wTXpY-pvsltCVEZ-wVir2g__thumb/img/B8qrSrIfS2Qs0vhkvzC-nAjKbJM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic575855.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wTXpY-pvsltCVEZ-wVir2g__original/img/uYpf9LloFDuqyS0h5lOljOCtdzg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic575855.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"The Game Master BV","designer":"Hans van Tol","artist":"Volkan Baga, Arenea Kunkeler","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.59129,"avgWeight":3.2348},{"bggId":32014,"name":"Confucius","description":"In the Celestial Empire of the Ming Dynasty the leading families vie with one another for political power and influence over the Imperial government.

If your interest runs to miniatures, the rules and charts need no changes to adapt to the &quot;big mat.&quot; Can you do better than Nelson? Or, will you do what no one ever did and defeat him in a fleet action? Sail alongside, for it's sure to be a Close Action.<br/><br/>(source: Clash fo Arms website)<br/><br/><br/>Close Action is all about teamwork and out-maneuvering one's enemy by coordinating the movements of a fleet of wooden ships.  You plot movement for your ships, send signals to your friendly captains, and assign crew to various tasks such as changing sails or firing the great guns.  Played on a hex grid, the ships move fairly accurately and historic battles can be recreated with lots of realism.  This games scales extremely well, playing as well if not better with 20 players as with 3, 4 or 5.<br/><br/>(source: user's description)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BXymVZczpgxeZY4sLcmEQQ__thumb/img/wlWnczOK4SmsCmcbmiLgxJ85Cl0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic216367.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BXymVZczpgxeZY4sLcmEQQ__original/img/5iwx6iYPUialCLSeJANQQ8Sw8bE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic216367.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":30,"yearPublished":1997,"publisher":"Clash of Arms Games","designer":"Mark A.

It is late December 1944 and, on the face of it, history has unfolded as we know it, but that could be about to change.<br/><br/>The Nazis have discovered a source of &quot;vril&quot; that has been brought back to the Reich for study. Vril is a source of energy that can control all types of matter. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms.<br/><br/>If the Nazis work out how to harness this power it will be more potent than the atomic bomb. The secret Nazi experiments are not just a threat to the outcome of the war, but to the entire world. Many different secret bunkers hold all manner of research into the properties of the enigmatic vril and we're sending you, the Reichbusters, on a mission to stop this research in its tracks!<br/><br/>Players will choose from a selection of Allied Heroes and visit R&amp;D to prepare equipment before venturing out on missions against the evil &quot;Vrilmeisters&quot;. Mission objectives will vary from mission to mission while secondary objectives could appear as the heroes explore the bunkers. Each mission will see the players facing off against more and more heinous enemies, from re-animated corpses to dark experiments, and from ferocious mutations gone wrong to the evil Vrilmeisters themselves.<br/><br/>Each mission begins with the heroes infiltrating, making the use of stealth, hidden actions and minimising noise to make their way towards their objective undetected. Players will have to choose how long to remain quiet because time will be of the essence.<br/><br/>Inevitably, however, the Nazis will discover the presence of the heroes and once the alarm is raised, players need to be prepared for all hell to break loose. Once the objective has been completed the heroes must escape to report back their success, however, anyone left behind will be captured and unavailable in future missions if playing a campaign.<br/><br/>Players will be able to take part in an ongoing Campaign of missions or they can set up a Raid with random maps, heroes, and Nazi faction to fight against.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Reichbusters: Projekt Vril is a fully co-operative game so the heroes will either succeed or fail together.<br/><br/>While remaining hidden players can choose the player order and on their turn players can take a number of actions including Moving, Fighting, Drawing, Picking up Items &amp; Interacting with board elements.<br/><br/>In addition to base actions, players will also have their hero specific card decks. These cards modify actions as they happen such as adding dice to attacks or making more tactical movement. The hero cards can also be used to take additional actions beyond your base actions.<br/><br/>Each hero also comes with exciting Feats which can be used to turn the tide or secure that crucial objective right when you need to. On top of that, each hero receives a number of &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; can be spent to automatically succeed at tests such as attacks. In desperate moments you can also use &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; to prevent failed tests, but this will find you running out of them fast!<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the players will find items that they can carry and use. Some of these will be things they are looking for as part of their missions. Other things will be useful stuff like medical supplies, vril healing potions, guns, grenades, etc.<br/><br/>Custom dice will be used to decide the outcome of attacks, defence and the impacts of noise created by players. Each card tells you how much noise it creates, and how much Nazi activity it triggers. The more cards you play, the more noise you generate, and the more the Nazis act in response.<br/><br/>The Nazi reinforcements will be relentless so the heroes need to complete their objective and escape before time runs out and they get overwhelmed by the Nazi forces and their vril tech.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8u1aHWfQzE57na8wsshZ1A__thumb/img/fpuGx1BkRa0jdog-cf4khMeBSVE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4511709.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8u1aHWfQzE57na8wsshZ1A__original/img/ikkrUtlCqS5IFDy7clURNHbwNpY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4511709.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Mythic Games","designer":"Jake Thornton","artist":"Aurelie Bouquet, Stéphane Gantiez, Catalin Lartist, Christophe Madura, Guillem H.

You are an investor, seeking to take advantage of their generous offer to make your fortune. However, your governments are not as benevolent as you first thought. They have begun to absorb fledgling rail companies, taking them away from those who worked so hard to build them by regulating impossible standards for new technology.

The games are staples at 18xx gaming conventions often as a palate cleanser after playing a longer title.

The beginning of a game only has Minor Companies running relatively simple operations and as the game progresses, new mechanisms like Merger Rounds and the National Railway are introduced.

In each round, a percentage of the types goes extinct, then players receive and spend evolutionary points to make their types either larger or smaller, and more versatile or more dedicated depending on what they think is appropriate for the landscape (which is scaled based on the number of players) and the current state of the game. Reproduction, movement, and lifespan can all be modified by players during the game. If a player meets the right conditions, they can play one development card from hand, gaining benefits from this.

He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.<br/><br/>Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.<br/><br/>At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.<br/><br/>The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.<br/><br/>A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.<br/><br/>If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? <br/>The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead. As the others take it in to account when searching for partners for their deals.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5d82sDNmdfmeqNggLolIfg__thumb/img/0KsEssRMPKpjqMFxeuGvFMT_oXg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic150184.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5d82sDNmdfmeqNggLolIfg__original/img/2-Ax40pP08mRGMRuYouSQvMf0Zk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic150184.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Altar Games","designer":"Vlaada Chvátil","artist":"Vlaada Chvátil, Milan Vavroň","honors":"2007 Hra roku Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[5],"avgRating":6.70588,"avgWeight":3.0118},{"bggId":159059,"name":"The King's Abbey","description":"In AD 1096, hope fills the air like a bird's song after a long winter, the seeming endless road of the Dark Ages may soon come to an end. For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.<br/><br/>Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!<br/><br/>The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.<br/><br/>Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6ZZ93C5kmjxeQ_79yQKkMA__thumb/img/tYrg1tTPo2O3Co7Fb8hiQRB9L0M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2521752.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6ZZ93C5kmjxeQ_79yQKkMA__original/img/gJeX6FmcBGa5-2BiuMCoPkGckPg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2521752.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Breaking Games","designer":"Randy Rathert","artist":"Randy Rathert, Anna Talanova","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3],"avgRating":6.90448,"avgWeight":3.2051},{"bggId":3577,"name":"Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game","description":"Three full days of Gettysburg at a small-unit level including counters for individual leaders and horses.

In addition to wheat and rice, other crops like tea, fruits, and sugarcane were grown on a large scale. Immigrating peasants changed their profession to become merchants and artisans.

Ireland was a poor country, but there is no lack of enthusiasm for railways among investors. Up to 13 5-share companies will start in a random sequence. Some of these companies will become successful, others, as a result of underinvestment, isolation or poor timing will struggle to survive. All is not lost for the strugglers, however. A unique shareholder voting mechanism allows companies to merge into 10-share companies(sometimes against their director&rsquo;s wishes) with their more or less successful neighbours.<br/>Track laying provides its own problems as many track tiles are unique. Often, there is no available tile to provide the most efficient route so a roundabout route sometimes must suffice. There are two types of track that can be built: broad gauge and narrow gauge. There are no purchasable narrow gauge locomotives; instead narrow gauge track operates in an abstract way and boosts the value of the broad gauge stations to which it connects.  <br/>Trains in 18Ireland are hex trains. They become obsolete in two stages: rusted trains may be bought back from the bank at half price (but also half capability) and continue to operate until they rot and are then removed. As the game progresses the train rush becomes brutal.

Experience has shown that at a low player count, this is a &ldquo;run good companies&rdquo; game. At a higher player count, the game is more combative as share portfolios are more diverse and the hostile merger becomes a bigger factor in the game.

Designed by a real-life space engineer with a PhD in long-duration spaceflight from MIT, Stellar Horizons is intended to be a plausible representation of the first steps of humanity towards the stars between 2030 and 2169, with each turn representing a year of time. You control your faction's space program, outposts, and fleets spanning across the solar system, although you also have some influence over your faction's politics back home on Earth as space development becomes more important.<br/><br/>Movement is based on real physics. You move from orbit to orbit, or conduct long range transfers to move between planetary systems like Earth, Mars, or Jupiter. As you send out robotic explorers and crewed vehicles to explore the solar system, they bring back valuable data to further your scientific research. Technologies are intended to represent plausible extrapolations of existing development during the next 150 years: there are no transporters or warp drive, but you will be able to develop rockets powered by fusion and even anti-matter. In the engineering and biology domains, you'll eventually be able to construct space elevators and put your crews into safe hibernation for long journeys.<br/><br/>You'll have access to a wide variety of robot explorers and crewed ships. These range from tiny probes intended to merely take photographs as you fly past Jupiter, to giant destroyers, cruisers, and battleships which ply the space lanes with peaceful or hostile intentions. New ship types become available as you gain access to better technology over the course of the game.<br/><br/>You'll be given a budget to spend on Earth and can also build bases to harvest minerals, organics, and fuel to expands your economy. You can also forge diplomatic relationships with players and non-player factions alike, and trade resources at their bases to earn extra cash. Each of the seven factions has different strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and available ships based on their unique geopolitical situation. Military conflict is certainly possible but not always encouraged. Stellar Horizons features more diplomatic, technological, and economic competition than outright combat, although neglecting warships entirely leaves you vulnerable to pirates, trade embargoes, and sneak attacks by rogue players and factions.<br/><br/>Stellar Horizons includes short co-operative and competitive scenarios lasting an hour or more, and campaigns lasting a day up to about a full weekend for experienced players. Up to seven players can play at a time and the game is most fun with at least two, but there are also one-player scenarios, and the campaigns are highly suited for solo play. There are three ways to win the campaign: be the first to develop an Interstellar Colonizer, terraform a world, or achieve dominance in space over your rivals.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KVk_KKHXZPPalLlCfvRhXQ__thumb/img/tZ9hbnSY_1PWDjbErY4APtwPa7Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4233224.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KVk_KKHXZPPalLlCfvRhXQ__original/img/Il4W2VyFlgKm1rL2XvIVEn0iOfs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4233224.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":7,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Andrew Rader","artist":"Brien J.

It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.<br/><br/>TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.<br/><br/>THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.<br/><br/>THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.<br/><br/>THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win.<br/>After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.<br/><br/>According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.<br/>Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.<br/><br/>Each round consists of the following phases:<br/>White Phase: Players use the white action card they chose to emphasize their strategy.<br/>Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.<br/>Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.<br/>Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.<br/><br/>END<br/>The game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds<br/><br/>MICROBADGES<br/> Tsukuyumi fan - logo<br/> Tsukuyumi fan - moon<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hnce1jWgrTJ3iIhCG9OGow__thumb/img/vxH1KAsDi_B8bNYFqw4dDLMkoXQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5259202.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hnce1jWgrTJ3iIhCG9OGow__original/img/HKNa0ZuCUP_tj8IXhXNvuMcRtGc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5259202.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Grey Fox Games","designer":"Felix Mertikat","artist":"Felix Mertikat","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,null],"avgRating":7.54402,"avgWeight":3.6667},{"bggId":217576,"name":"Hellenica: Story of Greece","description":"An explosion of creativity and violence erupted in the Aegean Basin in 800 B.C. that defined ancient Greece.

It is driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad and features adventure, politics and economics to deliver an unlimited sandbox experience. Each game the variables change: cards, player interactions, stories, strategies and threats. While the game has a strong pulp influence, its roots stem from Cold War studies. We have expanded upon this research to arrive at our game&rsquo;s premise: What would happen after a nuclear and biological apocalypse?<br/><br/>Our answer is Fallen Land. As a player, you are the leader of a unique faction of survivors competing for primacy in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America. You must manage and enhance your town, protect your citizens and secure resources. You will also have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery and betrayal by the other players. But that is just where the adventure begins! You must also direct your agents (a party of characters), to explore the rugged landscape, establish your territory and solidify your agenda.<br/><br/>Game play is comprised of Turns. Each represents one month and is divided into Phases and Sub-Phases. The First Player resolves each Phase and Sub-Phase followed clockwise by the other players, before proceeding to the next Phase or Sub-Phase. A Turn is over when all players have had the opportunity to act or pass on each Phase.<br/><br/>I. Effects Phase *<br/>    1.) Resolve.<br/><br/>II. Town Business Phase *<br/>    1.)

End Turn Phase *<br/>    1.) Adjust Turn Marker.<br/>    2.) Pass the First Player Sheet.<br/><br/><br/>    Resolve an Action Card in each Phase or Sub-Phase as directed by the card.<br/><br/><br/>A player's town is simulated by a Town Play Mat. Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.<br/><br/>    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. <br/> There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.<br/><br/>To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.<br/><br/>Adventure and intrigue await!  We hope you have the opportunity to play Fallen Land and that you enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed creating it for you.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xQMSWwsI8lBFF64th7F1Fg__thumb/img/oz6gKwr5sFR0nMyNENYsg2TqBYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4280565.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xQMSWwsI8lBFF64th7F1Fg__original/img/i3I2EVbgt1vIelOa39LmUiYaojs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4280565.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Fallen Dominion Studios, LLC","designer":"Sean Cahill, Jon Lonngren","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3],"avgRating":8.1724,"avgWeight":3.6765},{"bggId":201455,"name":"Assault of the Giants","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Based on the story first presented in the Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder adventure from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Assault of the Giants is a new board game designed by Andrew Parks for 3-6 players.

Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.<br/><br/>Space Race: The Board Game is a game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.<br/><br/>The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.<br/><br/>Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe.

Each family seeks to control one of four sectors (mining, industry, city, or commercial) while also striving to be Mayor to control the appointment of other players to offices.<br/><br/>The game takes place over three eras (turns/decades), each with multiple phases in which players are dealt eight cards &mdash; all with historic black-and-white photos from Colorado &mdash; and must discard one and bank two for their final turn. Cards are used to either play Municipal Muscle points to build, buy, or seize structures, or used for the &quot;event&quot; listed on every card. Cards can also be used to set yearly &quot;Headlines&quot; or &quot;Themes&quot; which evoke a movement in American society or technology and change VP awards or other variables in the game. Structures are scored by multiplying the amount the sector tracks have advanced by the number of buildings owned. Different tracks progress differently.<br/><br/>Finally, players can build parks, civic buildings, hospitals, and police stations. These buildings in turn affect further play and cause neighborhoods to have more political votes at turn's end, increase VPs for proximity, or protect against certain negative cards.<br/><br/>Forged in Steel is an organic building game in that all builds change the landscape and players may build only adjacent to where others have built &quot;the grid/network&quot;. At turn's end, the game decides how many immigrants come seeking jobs based on how many factories and commercial buildings were built that turn. Too many? Unrest grows and there could be a riot, undermining all of your recent city-building efforts. The National Guard will step in to help you, of course, but they are usually outnumbered, and there's often fighting in the streets, so be wary of not contributing to the &quot;Unrest Track&quot;.<br/><br/>Can your family negotiate the turbulent changes of the early 1900s and become the local political and economic powerhouse? From the New Deal, Women's Suffrage, City Beautiful and Spanish Flu, to sidewalks and paved streets, all aspects of a 1900s western American city are incorporated, and players will learn about the rise of those developments that changed cities, labor, industry, and society forever.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPienXFWIHoCy5snZcBZ2g__thumb/img/aC00_L47Wf5N_TS4L8m0XlC3low=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2813061.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPienXFWIHoCy5snZcBZ2g__original/img/OvPMVwmO3HFwhpvbtEBMAKELTl4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2813061.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Knight Works, LLC","designer":"Wade Broadhead","artist":"Jamie Noble-Frier","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.28103,"avgWeight":3.5294},{"bggId":280726,"name":"Legacies","description":"You are famous - one of the most well-known names of the early 19th Century.

Epic now has faster gameplay and less rulebook-reading during play.<br/><br/>It's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition) world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas. While many old-school fans of the 1st and 2nd edition felt the 3rd edition of the game lost too much distinction between units with the simplification, to this day Jervis Johnson says this is the game he is most proud of and it has a very smooth playing style.<br/><br/>Expansions:<br/><br/>    Adeptus Titanicus II<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented By<br/><br/>    Epic Armageddon<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hl-zso7dfnrduaP_kbt6zQ__thumb/img/PKUOIwHXOJiGv4mUVc79wAMlMQQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1882454.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hl-zso7dfnrduaP_kbt6zQ__original/img/xXeXUbOVrxuvkqBb0ry-MpNImv4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1882454.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1997,"publisher":"Games Workshop Ltd.","designer":"Andy Chambers, Jervis Johnson, Gavin Thorpe","artist":"John Blanche, Wayne England, David Gallagher, Mark Gibbons, Des Hanley, Neil Hodgson, Paul Smith, John Wigley, Richard Wright","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4],"goodPlayers":[3,null],"avgRating":6.63274,"avgWeight":3.193},{"bggId":1496,"name":"Imperium Romanum II","description":"&ldquo;The story, of Rome is the most splendid romance in all history...&rdquo;<br/>-F. Marion Crawford, Ave Roma Immortalis, II, IS<br/><br/>Seven centuries of history are contained in this box.<br/><br/>Imperium Romanum II is the game of the Roman Empire -the greatest and most glorious empire the world has ever known. The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units. The thirty-five scenarios examine every major Roman war, civil and external, through 700 years that shaped the Western World. <br/>Many games claim historical accuracy; players will be astonished at the wealth of historical detail in this one. Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>Imperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.<br/><br/>What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II <br/>Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. <br/>Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability.

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.<br/><br/>Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.<br/>There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.<br/><br/>The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.<br/><br/>Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)<br/>    over 2500 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)<br/>    a complete set of rules<br/>    a complete set of charts<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/>(source: back of the box and user's description)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/60YrvRsC8IcCD2hHibCmgQ__thumb/img/C1q1ad-28jRhsitwd703qQjAThg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic43415.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/60YrvRsC8IcCD2hHibCmgQ__original/img/of5rXQQs9A-PQF5xpz_oakPk13Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic43415.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1984,"publisher":"Game Designers' Workshop","designer":"John Astell, Rich Banner, Frank Chadwick","artist":"Rich Banner, Rodger B.

Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.<br/><br/>Each turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.<br/><br/><br/>Boże Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.<br/><br/>&quot;Nierządem Polska stoi&quot; -  nieźle ktoś powiedział;<br/>Lecz drugi odpowiedział, że nierządem zginie.<br/>Pan B&oacute;g nas ma jak błazn&oacute;w.

Każdy z graczy wciela się w rolę przyw&oacute;dcy jednej z gł&oacute;wnych familii magnackich tamtych czas&oacute;w. Biały kolor odpowiada rodowi Radziwiłł&oacute;w (herbu Trąby), czerwony odpowiada Sapiehom (herbu Lis), niebieski Potockim (herbu Piława), a ż&oacute;łty rodowi Leszczyńskich (herbu Wieniawa). Podczas rozgrywki gracze będą musieli szukać kompromisu pomiędzy interesem własnego rodu, a interesem całej Rzeczpospolitej.<br/><br/>Rozgrywka trwa cztery tury, każda z nich jest podzielona na kilka etap&oacute;w i faz. W każdej turze Rzeczpospolita będzie zmagała się z ościennymi państwami, kt&oacute;re będą pr&oacute;bowały dokonać na nią inwazji. P&oacute;łnocnym granicom Polski zagrażać będzie Zakon Krzyżacki, p&oacute;źniej Szwedzi, a na końcu zachłanni Prusacy. Z p&oacute;łnocnego wschodu grozić będzie coraz większa potęga Rosji. Z południowego wschodu będą nadchodzić nieujarzmieni Tatarzy. By z nimi walczyć, gracze będą mogli posiłkować się wojskami kozackimi, te jednak skore są do buntu. Na południu rozpościera się muzułmańska potęga Imperium Otomańskiego. Za wojnę z niewiernymi, graczy czeka największa chwała, będą mogli oni nawet iść na odsiecz Wiednia. Ostatnie ościenne mocarstwo &ndash; Imperium Habsburg&oacute;w &ndash; na początku gry zachowuje pozorną neutralność, jednak pr&oacute;buje zdominować Rzeczypospolitą politycznie. W ostatniej turze Habsburgowie ściągają jednak białe rękawiczki i przyłączają się do Rosji i Prus w celu rozebrania Polski.<br/><br/>Gracz, jako głowa magnackiej rodziny, będzie dysponował rzeszami szlacheckiej klienteli, gotowych do działania na jego rozkazy. Na początku każdej tury gracze decydują gdzie wyślą posłusznych im szlachcic&oacute;w. Za ich pomocą gracze będą werbować wojska, wysyłać zbrojne wyprawy, zdobywać władzę na sejmikach ziemskich i przewagę polityczną na dworze Kr&oacute;la. Szlachcice to najcenniejszy zas&oacute;b gracza i musi on rozważnie z nich korzystać.<br/><br/>Gracz będzie czerpał pieniądze z latyfundi&oacute;w, kt&oacute;rych ilość będzie m&oacute;gł zwiększać podczas gry. Zamożność latyfundi&oacute;w będzie zależała tego, czy w prowincji, w kt&oacute;rym się one znajdują, kwitnie pok&oacute;j, czy raczej była ona ofiarą zagranicznego najazdu. Ziemie ograbione i wyludnione przez Tatar&oacute;w nie dadzą dochodu por&oacute;wnywalnego z majątkami leżącymi w niezrujnowanej wojną prowincji. Gracze będą mogli rozwijać swoje latyfundia gospodarczo, poprzez zatrudnianie zarządc&oacute;w a nawet budowę miast.<br/><br/>Na prestiż rodu wpłynie sława zdobyta w bitwach, nawet jeśli toczone wojny nie zawsze będą wygrane.

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don &ndash; entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run&hellip;and when to strike.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;backhand blow&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Extensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>    Dynamic and fluid situation<br/>    All of the pivotal battles in AG South<br/>    The creation of the Stalingrad pocket<br/>    The relief effort and airlift<br/>    Mansteins famous Backhand Blow!<br/>    Follow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg: The Drive on Moscow game and system- refined based on player feedback<br/>    Player skill is highly rewarded<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Turn: Half-week<br/>    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>    Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Four 22 x 34&quot; maps (Maps A, B, C &amp; D)<br/>    One 8 x 11&quot; Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map<br/>    Eight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 36-page OCS rules booklet<br/>    One 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet<br/>    Two 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts &amp; Tables Folders<br/>    Four Player Aid cards<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Playing Time: 4-100 hours<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/><br/>(from the Game Box)<br/><br/><br/>All 4 maps were changed and reprinted in 2001.<br/>Updated and replaced by Case Blue.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tKdyKh_NLg5ikxzRXqAiPQ__thumb/img/0GiaiHXyV7JaGAmdP_dwq_fdUzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic40442.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tKdyKh_NLg5ikxzRXqAiPQ__original/img/iwcHsFnmvcCfrU9Yl5ncquiSlKU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic40442.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1994,"publisher":"The Gamers","designer":"Dean Essig","artist":"Dean Essig","honors":"1994 Charles S.

With roots tracing back to the classic Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.<br/><br/><br/>A World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9gjjgu37WqNSUd3sZsb-g__thumb/img/Af_3T6nTfTa0aN4DQZzCZzpu04w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic34304.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9gjjgu37WqNSUd3sZsb-g__original/img/KwPRlDFi7W4QAWvH7aObcCho3tM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic34304.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2003,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Bruce Harper","artist":"Rodger B.

From this vantage the Archmage and her Order of Mages ruled these lands for an Age, drawing together the warring magics of the mythic races into one all-powerful and cohesive force. That was, of course, before The Ending.<br/><br/>The Ruined City is now home to but a fragment of the mythic races that once served the Archmage and her Order. And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.<br/><br/>The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...<br/><br/>Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.<br/><br/>When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.<br/><br/>Each turn is formed of two phases:<br/><br/><br/>     The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents. <br/>     Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action. <br/>         Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.<br/>         Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.<br/>         Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).<br/>         Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area. <br/>         Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCEROEH7sFwvrjTwU16c7g__thumb/img/6vMnEdH24f8kjNUDyG74IsSaPWg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3537131.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCEROEH7sFwvrjTwU16c7g__original/img/l0ZEXkZz9COm83PtS1Woq1_bmfo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3537131.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Starling Games (II)","designer":"Tim Heerema","artist":"Enggar Adirasa, Dann May","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":6.67336,"avgWeight":3.25},{"bggId":238889,"name":"Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog","description":"'In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale...

In this game, players are the noble Lords of the north, looking to assist Noggin however they can in his adventures with resources and wise council.<br/><br/>Players use their influence to take actions on the board which as a back drop is Peter Firmin's classic hand drawn map of the Northlands. The time taken on each action is plotted on a roundel which acts as the game clock, changes the turn order and progresses the seasons. However Nogbad is never far away from the source of the Kingdom's troubles and Noggin must use his cleverness, intuition and resourcefulness to thwart Nogbad and confirm his position as King of the Nogs. The game ends when Noggin secures the crown or if Nogbad manages to get there first.<br/><br/>In Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog, players must work together to successfully complete the adventures revealed by the saga cards. By offering much needed resources and making key decisions that effect the progress of the adventures, players will, if successful add to Noggin's popularity.

Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.<br/><br/>The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.<br/><br/>As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.<br/><br/>Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.<br/><br/>Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules.

Since the system contains the remains of a collapsed star it was bound to be rich in heavy elements, ripe for industrialization. It was thus no surprise, that in 2104 this was one of the first extrasolar systems to be colonized. The surprise came 3 years later, when an ancient artefact belonging to a clearly alien civilization was discovered under the settlement. The observatories picked up the unmistakable tachyon radiation of a fleet slowing down from faster-than-light approaching the system - preparing for the worst case scenario, the UN dispatched its entire Armada to relieve the minimal defenses the settlement holds, while their scientists worked hard to decipher the alien communications, and understand their newfound enemy whose name was revealed to be the Aethyn.<br/><br/>Defence of Procyon III is a highly asymmetric game of four players in two teams: one player takes charge of the Alien space navy, one the Alien ground force, while the other team of the Human space navy admiral and the ground forces' commander stands in their way. The space board uses a hex board, while the ground board is a point-to-point network of locations. The game is played over 12 turns, using card driven, low luck mechanisms that quickly unfold into a fast paced game of combat strategy - presented with countless high quality miniatures in a rich, thematic world. The two commanders of a side will have to work together closely to make sure there are no weaknesses for the enemy to exploit, yet their different mechanisms and different theaters will ensure each player is comfortably occupied with their own responsibilities - avoiding the alpha player issue common in team games.<br/><br/>The game also comes with an automated opponent that takes charge of one of the side.

There&rsquo;s nowhere left to run, and all that&rsquo;s left is survival. There is no rescue party waiting, no help from kind strangers...in the world of The Walking Dead, there is no sanctuary&hellip;<br/><br/>The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary is a cooperative board game of desperate survival set in the world of the popular AMC television series. Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members&rsquo; interests may be at odds.<br/><br/>No Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group&rsquo;s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group&rsquo;s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.<br/><br/>Each survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor&rsquo;s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group&rsquo;s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!<br/><br/>With its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show&rsquo;s storylines!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mSA3pqfVxYHJGhtBDQbPaw__thumb/img/TWV5Rt2Dw54lB-D5ITBkOdkNIik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3097992.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mSA3pqfVxYHJGhtBDQbPaw__original/img/Ff0ILFN0-ncFypbjFTs8FtaMLQs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3097992.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Cryptozoic Entertainment","designer":"Adam Sadler, Brady Sadler","artist":"Giorgio De Michele","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":6.80114,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":2800,"name":"The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865","description":"(from a Yaquinto ad:)<br/><br/>The IRONCLADS is a tactical level, simultaneous movement, game of ship-to-ship combat in the American Civil War.

The Transcontinental Railroad will be a epic feat of engineering - combining advanced construction techniques with raw human power and determination.  A fortune is to be made for those who can build the track the fastest!  Your task is to build an efficient team of workers, plan out your route and race the other players to connect both coasts first!<br/><br/>In Pacific Rails Inc., players are the Presidents of rival railway companies.  Using worker placement and resource management, players compete to build a continuous track from one side of the board to the other.  When the two sides meet, the end of the game is triggered and glory await those who have built the best railway.<br/><br/>The core mechanic of the game is worker placement.  On your turn, you either place a worker onto an action, or remove an existing worker.  If you place adjacent to one of your own workers, your actions are powered up.  Planning out a sequence of action is vital to get the best results.  Keep an eye on the other players and try to block them if they are building up to a super move.<br/><br/>You are also building up your team during the game.  Your engine starts with just the foreman.  You can hire extra Specialists to your train that allow you to build more track, lobby Congress and give you powerful actions.  Add in some carriage bonuses and you are on the way to creating a powerful engine that will allow powerful actions to be chained together producing epic turns that will show your mastery of the rails!<br/><br/>Once you have your track ready, you need to plan out the best route.  You need to have the tracks ready to match the terrain you wish to cover and decide which cities to connect and which to skip.  You must be able to complete a connection to the next city in one action - so make sure you're not missing any tracks!  Also watch what your rivals are up to - points are on offer if you can get them to use your connected cities.<br/><br/>In addition to the fun game play, Pacific Rails Inc has amazing art by Damien Mammoliti, well known for his work on the games Brass, Nocturion, and more.

To get these riches won't be easy; it'll require lots of work to install lunar probes, process extracted minerals, and ensure the working conditions of scientists and engineers in the crew.<br/><br/>In Luna Maris, you take on the role of a coordinator in charge of the lunar operations of a big company, organizing the crew, fulfilling demands, supplying worker's necessities, improving rooms in the complex, and respecting the strict environmental parameters. You start the game with six scientist cards, with which you can perform actions; to do so, place a scientist meeple in a room in the lunar complex, discard the appropriate scientist card, pay the activation cost (energy, water, oxygen, etc.), then receive the benefits of that room. The ten rooms each have their particularities and special rules:<br/><br/><br/>    Exploration Plant: Astronauts go out to the base to extract minerals.<br/>    Industrial Complex: Process extracted minerals. Also, control the air filters and decrease the CO2 emissions.<br/>    Greenhouse: Create food to sustain the crew members.<br/>    Expedition Area: Ship cargo to Earth and receive victory points.<br/>    Mining Room: Extract basalt and titanium to sustain a high level of production.<br/>    Communication Room: Hire better scientists and improve the human resources of the lunar base.<br/>    Power Plant: Juice the solar boards for an extra energy supply.<br/>    Recycling Plant: Recycle your waste to obtain resources in a green sustainable economy.<br/>    Laboratory: Use research to improve the Industrial Complex, Recycling Plant, and other facilities.<br/>    Dormitory: Take time off to recuperate.<br/><br/><br/>A game lasts five rounds, and during that time you can focus on installing lunar probes and producing raw resources; investing in the industrial complex to guarantee access to water and helium-3; hiring high-level scientists and optimizing your actions; or doing other things that will deliver victory points in the long run. After five rounds, players tally their scores to see who runs the base and who gets ejected into orbit.

Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles.

The system encompasses (as of 6/2001) Barbarossa: Army Group North (2000), Barbarossa: Army Group Center (1998), and Barbarossa: Army Group South (1996). Typhoon! (1995) is the progenitor of these games, and its system is quite similar, but it is unfortunately subtly incompatible with the later games.<br/><br/>While not simple, these games are also not overly complex and present an excellent simulation of the early war. Most of the details of the campaigns are covered in a playable manner. Perhaps the most obviously interesting detail is the sequence of play, which is asymmetrical to account for the difficulties the Soviets labored under. Make no mistake, the Soviets are going to take a lot of abuse, but this is no walkover for the Germans and both sides are interesting to play.<br/><br/>(BGG user description)<br/><br/><br/>Errata counters contained in Barbarossa: Crimea.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRCiMfp7KelP-Covexh3bg__thumb/img/F5awF9BlqBhLFW3OOb5DE8x2i_k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic773842.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRCiMfp7KelP-Covexh3bg__original/img/CeKWTHMoOtmJwLFTE6FGiLnk1Fw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic773842.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1998,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Tony Curtis, Vance von Borries","artist":"Rodger B.

These oases of heat are vital for survival...and, unfortunately, only transient. To make things worse, a strange sickness spreads around them: The Bane.

If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.<br/><br/>Specifically:<br/><br/><br/>    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..<br/><br/><br/><br/>    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). <br/><br/><br/>So, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you! Enjoy!<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>     A revised Command System, using Maximum Effectiveness to portray the strengths and vicissitudes of battlefield command.<br/>     Seven scenarios, from microcosm 1-mappers to the full 3-day battle.<br/>     Brigadiers rated with Action Profiles so that, when on their own, you may never know exactly what they'll do! Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain lost honor? Will a cautious Stannard sit and watch? Or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottle instead of the front line?<br/>     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, special rules for green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.<br/>     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack: you can roll up the enemy's flank in one massive charge. <br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 Scenario Booklet<br/>    1 Great Battles of the American Civil War Rules Booklet<br/>    6 Full-color Countersheets.<br/>    3 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>    1 Player Aid Card (11&quot; x 17&quot;)<br/>    1 Union AM Sheet<br/>    1 Confederate AM Sheet<br/>    1 Union Reinforcement Schedule<br/>    1 Confederate Reinforcement Schedule<br/>    1 Gettysburg Turn Track &amp; 2nd Disorder Card<br/>    1 Orders Chart/Terrain Effects Card<br/>    1 10-sided die<br/><br/><br/>Designer: Richard H.

The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game.<br/><br/>Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.<br/><br/>This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CYSqGJpe6tK9bLSDicnbRQ__thumb/img/ehn9vfAalwq2BVchfk9mHRuCovU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1525945.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CYSqGJpe6tK9bLSDicnbRQ__original/img/UMNfsVCg5EPxVYkblGEDzI5mlgo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1525945.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2004,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Richard H.

Optional rules re-create political situations faced by the major powers.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    2 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps<br/>    32 pg rule booklet<br/>    2 Player aids cards<br/>    800 die-cut counters<br/><br/><br/>Ages 12 through adult.<br/>PLAYING TIME: 4 to 50 HOURS<br/><br/>(source: back of TSR edition)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cq_Sknj0rarntiZS4bMgzg__thumb/img/zGR39uH2yTJK0_El-BlrjhWNxyM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic277947.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cq_Sknj0rarntiZS4bMgzg__original/img/mqp1bKT-5fwD2nHkFIdNgfXtRnE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic277947.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1985,"publisher":"SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)","designer":"Douglas Niles","artist":"Jeff Easley","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2,5],"avgRating":7.23759,"avgWeight":3.9796},{"bggId":1796,"name":"Pampas Railroads","description":"Players vie for control of six railroads in Argentina.  A deck of cards (3 Offer Stock, 4 Develop Settlements, 5 Construct Track) is used each round to determine player actions.  The deck is passed to the left and an action taken until there is just one action card type left in the deck.  Dividends are then paid (based on railroad value and total number of shares), and a new round is started.  The game lasts for nine rounds, at which time a final payoff is made based on value, income, and actual shares sold.  There are only 5 shares of each railroad available, with the money from the stock purchase going into the railroad treasury.  Also, all track construction must be paid for out of railroad treasuries, and the track is drawn along pre-defined routes using plastic crayons.  Settlements are developed using player funds, which in turn increases the income available to a railroad.

His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; collection of folk stories.<br/><br/>In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.<br/><br/>Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.<br/><br/>The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players's influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.<br/><br/>Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.<br/><br/>The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.<br/><br/>The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.<br/><br/>Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1NdH2ApZh4gMHsuj1D9-zA__thumb/img/BeCK__SuW6dAoWnXHJTK0snJ530=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1356506.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1NdH2ApZh4gMHsuj1D9-zA__original/img/ttJWk7U0pm9cXM9Xmi5Jwzqh2Io=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1356506.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Yemaia","designer":"Giorgio De Michele, Pierluca Zizzi","artist":"Simone Gabrielli","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.59963,"avgWeight":3.4615},{"bggId":71668,"name":"After Pablo","description":"The bloody saga of Mexican and Colombian cartels following Pablo Escobar's death.<br/> It's 1994.

From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?<br/><br/>Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)<br/>     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)<br/>     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)<br/>     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)<br/>     Research (select an available technology)<br/><br/><br/>In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.<br/><br/>The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yt9Ued8Uzt1bAoSL2hMQXA__thumb/img/S0e6XgAtCcNRNbuKqzfG3mSjtD0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2061273.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yt9Ued8Uzt1bAoSL2hMQXA__original/img/gjqHrLRsisz183u7TnxN5k03kkk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2061273.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"(Web published)","designer":"Nigel Buckle","artist":"Nemanja Stankovic","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":6.93056,"avgWeight":3.1429},{"bggId":25008,"name":"Italia","description":"Italia brings to life almost 1500 years of Italian history, from 330 BC to AD 1100.

There doesn't exist a better place for a new city!<br/><br/>The two grandsons of the King of Albalonga &ndash; the twins Romolo and Remo, descendants of Enea of Troy &ndash; don't want to miss an opportunity to dominate the region and, acting against each other, try to establish two cities close to the Tiber river. Their enterprise is not easy as the King of Antemnae and the King of Crustumerium will also fight to dominate this area! Who will prevail?<br/><br/>In Romolo o Remo?, players act as Kings of the new cities in the Latium and have to compete with each other in order to gain control of the whole Region. Players must manage their kingdom and their growing settlement. Two aspects are crucial: the citizens, as players act with citizens to take many different actions, and the territory, as players can act only in the territories they are able to control &ndash; excluding when they go to war, of course! If the population grows, they can take more actions, but they must feed all of them as well.

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CokqERxkceU9XKnTT3rhLQ__thumb/img/TP3yYmJAxmfwN7t96tMnoCTv7Uw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic224206.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CokqERxkceU9XKnTT3rhLQ__original/img/SDNB-lOSU01uvi3gFZDokcQPcpI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic224206.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":9,"yearPublished":1974,"publisher":"Hartland Trefoil Ltd.","designer":"Francis Tresham","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6,7],"goodPlayers":[3,8,9],"avgRating":7.01217,"avgWeight":3.7619},{"bggId":3711,"name":"Flight Leader","description":"(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>FLIGHT LEADER puts YOU in the cockpit or a high-performance jet fighter, commanding two to eight high performance aircraft, YOUR mission is to establish &quot;air superiority&quot; by clearing the enemy from the skies.

The Circleville earthworks, as described in 1772, comprised an 1,100-foot diameter circle connected to a 900-foot square. Town director Daniel Dreisbach plotted the town directly atop the earthworks, integrating the town plan into the landscape. An octagonal courthouse stood directly in the center of the circular road system in the center of town.<br/><br/>To the dismay of Dreisbach, however, the people of Circleville hated the circular roads. People complained that the round roads forced everyone to build on oddly-shaped lots and caused confusion. By the mid-1830s, enough dissatisfaction arose with Circleville's unique radial concentric road layout that the townsfolk petitioned the State Assembly to change it.<br/><br/>The Circleville Squaring Company, authorized in 1837, undertook a project to convert the &quot;peculiar&quot; town plan into a more conventional grid. Circleville occupies a unique place in the history of American town planning as one of the earliest examples of urban redevelopment in the United States.<br/><br/>In Squaring Circleville, you work for the Circleville Squaring Company to manage the process of deconstructing and reconstructing the town of Circleville. You will move around the courthouse rondel getting permits to perform work, such as deconstructing and constructing roads and demolishing and building structures.<br/><br/>As the game proceeds, you become more experienced and are able to do an amazing amount of work in the same amount of time.

That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.<br/><br/>Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.<br/><br/>As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.<br/><br/>110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.<br/><br/>Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.<br/><br/>Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.<br/><br/>The Campaign and the Scenarios:<br/><br/>&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?<br/><br/>&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?<br/><br/>In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. <br/>The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A6ZcHe2YhAxq3HmAw8Io_Q__thumb/img/QzmOJcwweSWuztVZGcRU5V49XUM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic368807.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A6ZcHe2YhAxq3HmAw8Io_Q__original/img/Ll6E0HOph2e_18OtPPrGC3y86oI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic368807.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Mark McLaughlin, Fred Schachter","artist":"Rodger B.

You must wait until a player activates that location (which activates it for all players on that location).

Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?<br/><br/>Hegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.<br/><br/>The Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.<br/><br/>While players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your class to victory?<br/><br/>Hegemony is heavily based on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging gameplay.

The battles included are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buena Vista, the classic battle of the war, with Zach Taylor's decimated army making a valiant stand against Santa Anna and a force three times Taylor's. <br/>    Monterey, with the North Americans launching a three-pronged assault against, into, and through the beautiful city of Monterey, complete with huge fortifications, high peaks, bull rings, cathedrals filled with ammunition, even a telegraph system. <br/>    Cerro Gordo, Scott's first meeting with Santa Anna, on the dangerous mountain roads leading towards the heart of Mexico. <br/>    El Molino del Rey, where Santa Anna makes a last, well-entrenched stand outside Mexico City.

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).<br/><br/>As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.<br/><br/>The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.<br/><br/>The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout.

By mid-January of 1944, the Red Army had liberated the area north and east of the Dnepr and seized Kiev. Further south, they crossed the Dnepr bend, capturing Kirovograd and continued deep into the western Ukraine.  The Germans, however, maintained a hold on the Dnepr near Korsun in an exposed salient 70 miles southwest of Kiev.  Hitler insisted on holding the salient and refused requests from his generals to withdraw to more defensible positions.  This exposed salient was too tempting a target for the Soviets and in January, 1944 Stavka ordered the 1st &amp; 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to conduct a major operation; striking against the base of the salient to surround and eliminate two German Corps within.  The 2nd Ukrainian Front would breakthrough in the east on the 25th and race westward while the 1st Ukrainian Front would attack toward the east a day later; sealing the pocket at Zvenigorodka.  The Soviet offensive was a stunning success, slamming the gate on 60,000 men from six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.  But, the Germans were not about to let the Korsun pocket become another &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.  Within a week they struck back with eight panzer divisions in a two-pronged counter-stroke of their own; this time to deal the Red Army an unexpected defeat from the Jaws of Victory.<br/><br/>Seven separate scenarios covering the period from January 26 to February 18, including a 25-turn campaign game, allow both sides plenty of opportunities for offensive and defensive action.<br/><br/>As the Soviet player, you begin with a two-pronged offensive, striking hard at the base of the German salient in an attempt to trap as many German units as possible.  If you succeed, you must then turn your attention southward to build the &quot;outer ring&quot; in preparation for the German counter-offensive, while systematically chewing away at the supply-starved defenders in the pocket.<br/><br/>As the German player, you must slow the Soviet drives from both east and west by fighting a two-front defense, and if possible bring them to a halt.  Once the pocket forms, you must skillfully hang on and preserve as many of the trapped units as possible, and wait for you Panzer Divisions from the south to carve open an escape route.<br/><br/>And both sides will have to contend with overstretched supply line, bad weather, and tank-stopping mud.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>    Five dual-side printed countersheet (1,170 1/2&quot; counters - 4 full size &amp; 1 half countersheets)<br/>    One 32-page Jaws of Victory Rule Book<br/>    One 28-page Jaws of Victory Play Book<br/>    One single-side printed Game-Turn Record Track<br/>    One dual-side printed Sequence of Play Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Phase Sequence Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed German Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Soviet Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Terrain Effects Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Results Table<br/>    Eight Dual-Side printed Scenario Cards (4 German &amp; 4 Soviet)<br/>    One dual-side printed Combat Manuals/Credits/Historical wrapper<br/>    One single-side printed Game Errata card<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Moderate-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6-50 hours<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0_4HaT2y0bGSjt7DSTmnzw__thumb/img/z0v0f-a1PMPUmI4T0aQIjtMZRQw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5227968.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0_4HaT2y0bGSjt7DSTmnzw__original/img/NI1n2Y01zsDb53xKAVlHyrYnvKk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5227968.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"New England Simulations","designer":"Milt Janosky","artist":"Mark Hinkle","honors":"2020 Charles S.

As a player and administrator of a coal mine, you experience an exciting competition and live through a piece of Ruhr Valley history. You bring coal and overburden from underground to the surface, let your miner go through a &quot;shift at the colliery&quot;, produce coke, or build the typical colliery settlements.<br/><br/>A game of Schichtwechsel takes place over five rounds, and each round consists of three phases: The preparation phase in which, among other things, the amount of mined coal is determined; the action phase in which players use their action pieces wisely in turn; and a small end-of-round evaluation. After the fifth round is a final scoring.

This 35-year long conflict saw the extinction of a large number of noble houses, and would eventually set the house of Tudor upon the throne.<br/><br/>In Crown of Roses, players take on the roles of the dynastic giants - the House of Lancaster and their Beaufort cousins, and the House of York. The four player game adds in the powerful House of Stafford, and the ever-scheming Richard Neville and his son, Richard of Warwick, the 'Kingmaker'.<br/><br/>Using intuitive mechanics, Crown of Roses offers players a historical feeling with tremendous strategic depth and excellent replayability. Unit starting locations vary with each turn and even with each game, and the use of blocks creates the &quot;fog of war&quot; of limited intelligence on enemy strength and deployment. Random game events throw a touch of the chaos of the era into the mix, and the multiple uses for the player action cards leads to a level of uncertainty where enemy plans are concerned.<br/><br/>During each game turn in Crown of Roses, players will play cards to perform actions such as improving their armies, influencing the locals to support them, collecting supplies or prestige, moving to attack enemy forces, to recruit new houses to your cause, calling another Royal Heir into the fray, or even changing the nature of the conflict through the use of player events.<br/><br/>Unit blocks rotate to show strength, and each army can have a variety of experience levels and combat capabilities. A novel roll to hit-based system is used to determine combat results, with better experienced forces scoring hits more often in battle.

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.<br/><br/>The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.<br/><br/>During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.<br/><br/>If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IZZkfhQhFClHGwD5ZRA3_A__thumb/img/QtEzjmMNGx8r3n0mMnsyeaymzLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic822328.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IZZkfhQhFClHGwD5ZRA3_A__original/img/kyCxq1ZwUqGZWetWlIgTQW1_ZcU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic822328.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2011,"publisher":"Rio Grande Games","designer":"Walter H.

The continent has been bought and broken in two by experiments of a powerful corporation Cerbero. Now it kneels divided waiting for the fall. The government is non-existent and so are any laws of men. Desolated wastelands are roamed by mutated beasts, decades-old machines running on corrupted software and degenerate humans who are  even more dangerous. In those few pockets of civilization left people are more interested in survival than in progress. Values like compassion and responsibility are scarce &ndash; even scarcer are fuel and ammo needed to face new reality. But things are about to change as there are still those who care. Will you muster enough hope to fight for better future? Will you stand tall and shine the beacon of your courage in this darkest of times? The Waste is calling &ndash; better be ready to answer&hellip;<br/><br/>Waste Knights is a post-apocalyptic adventure game for 2-4 players set in dystopian Australia now called the Waste.  Each player becomes a hero who travels around the continent fighting monstrous enemies, accomplishing Tasks to acquire new Gear Cards and hoping to gain enough Reputation in order to fulfill the Mission being played. All players share a common goal set by the Mission, but only the quickest and the most cunning will manage to win!<br/><br/>Waste Knights features unique rules&rsquo; systems. Players need to manage 4 different resources: Fuel, Ammo, Health and Radiation as reaching a certain level in any means almost certain death in the Waste. They move using different Vehicles, face threats shown on Wasteland Cards and explore various locations on a modular, hexagonal map that is formed of 37 hexes. Combat is both deadly and rewarding as players set the range, utilize Combat Cards with different maneuvers and have various melee and ranged weapons at their disposal. Additionally the Waster, the person opposite the active player, controls the game to some extent choosing threats and making combat decisions for enemies.<br/><br/>But Waste Knights is not only about fighting and moving. Players progress by accomplishing Tasks &ndash; short quests given by inhabitants of the Waste. Some of them require tactical acumen, others are based on Skill tests or getting certain goods. Finally, a unique barter system allows players to trade Gear Cards of different colors as in the post-apocalyptic future there is no currency system whatsoever. Thanks to this some players will win by strength while others by brains &ndash; and all will have a good time playing!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOhH25TPDiKqIQ2dJPBpKQ__thumb/img/pPLjzA73LUbXh6KzRZRS3MfUI9Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2695002.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOhH25TPDiKqIQ2dJPBpKQ__original/img/eGvrgc59jTp1jgi7blZhimxufz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2695002.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Badger's Nest","designer":"Marek Mydel","artist":"Damian Bajowski, Aleksander Karcz, Piotr Rossa, Michał Teliga","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":6.52807,"avgWeight":3.6087},{"bggId":11967,"name":"The Seven Days of 1809: Napoleon and the Archduke Charles","description":"The Battles of Abensberg, Eckm&uuml;hl, and Ratisbon.<br/><br/>Seven Days of 1809 uses the game system that first appeared in &quot;Six Days of Glory,&quot; which covers the Battles near Montmirail in February of 1814.<br/><br/>GAME SYSTEM: DAYS System <br/>- scale = 1,600m/hex, <br/>- time = 6 hours/GT,<br/>- strength = 800-1,000 men/SP, .<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOjnzQEISmM9-M4etxemQg__thumb/img/YDnUa2u2rOsOn0qJp5KJDxQkcJc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic51697.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOjnzQEISmM9-M4etxemQg__original/img/BbCcQIifO-Ar_UcTGhxYEVhqdo8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic51697.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2004,"publisher":"OSG (Operational Studies Group)","designer":"Kevin Zucker","artist":"Christopher Moeller, Mark Simonitch","honors":"1987 Charles S.

Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.<br/><br/>The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play. Full-color box-miniatures are placed on tilt-blocks and stacking tiles showing altitude, pitch, roll and heading and bringing the three-dimensional fight to life.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwtGjwYkkMCzBYESI5PVGQ__thumb/img/4tIfqyZ3mot8Jf8Ta3hI9Xmfm0E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic301949.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwtGjwYkkMCzBYESI5PVGQ__original/img/QFay_-hxSgDrKpP_DAI-3F8DdS0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic301949.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"Ad Astra Games","designer":"Philip A.

Movement is either simultaneous (in three phases) or secretly written down, depending on what the players agree.<br/>In summer and autumn it is the same but in autumn you have to be back at your own fields to supervise the harvest and make sure the farmers give all their grain to their master. <br/>Winter gives time to reorder the belongings and spend the gold earned over the year. You have to pay salaries for your men which improve their combat strength for experience, may hire new knights and mercenaries or concentrate on your economy. If you expand too fast without buying beehives, hire fishermen and  foresters you won&acute;t be able to maintain your landed properties. This is the time to build castles and mills as well. At the beginning of the next year a random event happens (such as plague, floods or robber barons coming to the valley).<br/>The optional rules add religion (you have to choose a religion and build churches or celtic stone circles) and honour, weather (which influences the harvest) and loyalty of your troops. <br/>Winner is the player who owns first 21 of the 40 fiefs or has the highest amount of honour after ten years of play (optional).<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YAiSIc7n1Q0B9idGqKfIPg__thumb/img/H20nF7EF_OBKq4ZaTZRijDdJhmw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic746214.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YAiSIc7n1Q0B9idGqKfIPg__original/img/pgbNPF1xzifMfB4ykDcxvdVMkAk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic746214.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":1989,"publisher":"Lancelot Games","designer":"Chris Courtiour, Richard Milner, Julian Musgrave, Dieter Schmidt, Jamie Walker","artist":"Aubrey Beardsley, Hubert de Lartigue, Ed Dovey, Frank Gerwin, Jürgen Pirner","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,6],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":6.28991,"avgWeight":3.0606},{"bggId":152172,"name":"Nova Aetas","description":"Nova Aetas: Dark Renaissance Tactical Game is a battle boardgame set  in an alternative Italian Renaissance, where Middle Ages stories - rediscovered through the study of classical civilizations - are considered to be real, like the fauns inhabiting the woods, as well as Cyclops, Witches and Chimeras.<br/><br/>The players, once formed their Free Company, will face a series of intense missions against cunning enemies with a fine artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Nova Aetas has been designed to offer high playability and longevity, the main campaign has three different endings.<br/><br/>Challenge the game relying only on your own strength, control up to four characters struggling against the game.<br/><br/>Play in a party with your friends, venture into the events narrated by the main campaign or take the challenges of the missions.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tOEi35IWmlvPdADpBTTrQw__thumb/img/5DdNSc4A5d3_Vuqk2xdr7Vhw0Fc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1902288.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tOEi35IWmlvPdADpBTTrQw__original/img/4mDtC6ZDtjbDiR92Bglw8Cau-sc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1902288.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Ludus Magnus Studio","designer":"Luca Bernardini, Andrea Colletti, Daniele Colletti","artist":"Fernando Armentano, Josè Alejandro Lupico Barca, Antonio De Luca, Tommaso Incecchi, Giovanni Pirrotta, Paolo Scippo","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3],"avgRating":7.27775,"avgWeight":3.5},{"bggId":172206,"name":"Bomarzo","description":"In the XVI century Italy was the scene of wars and dynastic quarrels. In the Papal States, Pope Paul III knew he could rely on the strength of the powerful Orsini family to oppose the power of his enemies. In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.<br/><br/>In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.<br/><br/>Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BwHOqRJUL2llZVvc8WzS1Q__thumb/img/EAKyTyNZYuSSwlVpDaqtwwH-vaI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2991736.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BwHOqRJUL2llZVvc8WzS1Q__original/img/1lEhxWqWlY2vwAu-7WkjSonH3UQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2991736.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Giochix.it","designer":"Stefano Castelli","artist":"Marina Fischetti","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":6.52369,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":282438,"name":"Throne of Allegoria","description":"In the land of Allegoria, Queen Gwendoline lies on her deathbed.

Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.<br/><br/>Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.<br/><br/>The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).<br/><br/>Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.<br/><br/>Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.<br/><br/><br/>As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.<br/><br/>There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.<br/><br/>Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PcBfBZb3cqi9y4ETbPpeQw__thumb/img/c7KYccv2Rso95nHPz4VACiF2i7c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic168409.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PcBfBZb3cqi9y4ETbPpeQw__original/img/5k4ZnPouSAZNUqKCtmENW6KOLis=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic168409.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2001,"publisher":"Avalanche Press Ltd.","designer":"Brian L.

The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.<br/><br/>Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.<br/><br/>In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.<br/><br/>During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ERxFy63c7lYYmkYSgF__Kg__thumb/img/RsgIzUmZcnrswcWCwq12ndyqnQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3114486.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ERxFy63c7lYYmkYSgF__Kg__original/img/x7nx1DGW9LhMImwSLsVxuNefTeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3114486.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Devir","designer":"Marco Maggi, Francesco Nepitello","artist":"David Parcerisa, Jordi Roca Parse","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.43572,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":318450,"name":"Bios: Mesofauna","description":"Bios:Mesofauna is an alternative Bios:Megafauna.

Each player rules over a civilization in the ancient world, attempting exploits that will be remembered long after the civilization has withered. Each turn, players will select two action cards, which represent edicts delivered by the player to his populace, announcing what aspects of the empire he/she wishes to address:  building structures, implementing advances, migrating population, initiating combat, annexing new territories, instituting reforms to manage the empire&rsquo;s unrest, building trade routes, demanding tribute, and -- crucially &ndash;- recording Chronicles about his/her reign.<br/><br/>The central element of the game's scoring system, Chronicle cards represent claims of great accomplishments.  To score a chronicle, the player must have a &quot;heritage&quot; level commensurate with the claim he/she is making:  claims of great works will only be believed and perpetuated if the player's civilization has established a reputation in the relevant civilization category (cultural, civil, or political).<br/><br/>Actions generally require the payment of resources (crops or gold), and action costs correlate either to the player's empire size or the player's Unrest level.  Unrest increases when a player's territories become too crowded, or when a player re-uses an action card, or when a player voluntarily presses on his populace to squeeze additional productivity out of them.

Agents assigned to the Warehouse risk their lives to retrieve these artifacts to keep them away from nefarious individuals who seek to use the artifacts for personal gain. In Warehouse 13: The Board Game, players take on the role of Warehouse Agents who must work together to retrieve these artifacts. But is everyone looking out for the Warehouse's interests, or might one of the Agents be secretly working for the Warehouse's most ruthless adversary?<br/><br/>Warehouse 13: The Board Game can be played by three to five players in about two hours. Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.<br/><br/>After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent must perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent must draw a free Trait.<br/><br/>The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.<br/><br/>Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly. If the Agents believe they have determined who the Traitor is, they can vote to Bronze that player, which reveals their Loyalty.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkhubY9kZqnmc3U3A-CEZw__thumb/img/Tm6Iaj7cjPVMow0VfYdif5KF9EY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3358873.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkhubY9kZqnmc3U3A-CEZw__original/img/tNaWd_0V6N0UEysOJ-B5ObUlkI8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3358873.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Infinite Dreams Gaming","designer":"Michael Aldridge, Russ Rupe, M.

Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.<br/><br/>(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)<br/><br/>Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.<br/><br/>The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.<br/><br/>Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.<br/><br/>Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1<br/>power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.<br/><br/>Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6h2-_jM23HFv4F3IMrAZOw__thumb/img/tAhGZf9CK28GvfyzLa49zT8_zoE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic75374.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6h2-_jM23HFv4F3IMrAZOw__original/img/AE4cJtYZ1tVZykziSn2M5dn0sIw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic75374.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1981,"publisher":"Excalibre Games, Inc.","designer":"S.

NATO simulates a potential NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict in Central Europe during the Cold War years of the 1980's. First published in 1983, this game was Victory Games best-selling title, purchased by over 75,000 gamers worldwide. This new edition is based on an exhaustive two-year study by the Designer of the records that have come to light since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The game combines highly accurate information on the forces the Warsaw Pact actually had with now de-classified reports from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency regarding what satellite surveillance and HUMINT revealed about their actual plans. The map has also been extensively updated with new satellite geography. Finally, the game system has been reworked to better reflect the fluid, fast paced and deadly nature of modern warfare, while retaining the original intention of simple and intuitive play. Here is the ultimate Cold War game, remastered, and playable in a single sitting.<br/><br/>NATO is a division/brigade level simulation of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. The game map depicts the area from Denmark to the Swiss Alps, and from France to Poland.  The time frame covers the first 14 days of war, after which one side or the other has usually run out of an army. The game offers four different Scenarios, covering 1) a surprise attack from a standing start, 2) an attempt by the WP to quietly prepare without tipping NATO off beforehand, 3) an extended buildup of forces by both sides before war breaks out, and 4) an introductory scenario covering the invasion of Denmark.<br/><br/>Each Scenario can be played with an Order of Battle from 1983, when NATO was still relatively weak, or with an Order of Battle from 1988, when NATO had rearmed and reorganized and was at the peak of its strength. The difference is impressive.<br/><br/>The game features infantry, armor, airborne and airmobile troops, marines, with easy mechanics to leverage combined arms operations. It also has extensive options for employing air power, chemical weapons and, for the truly desperate player, a last resort to nuclear weapons. The combat system is built around the concept that the best defense is a good offense, and features artillery, tactical and operational air strikes, reserves, counterattacks and deep exploitation, allowing for a rich set of tactical nuances in play. This is not a game where the WP attacks and NATO defends. Both players have to attack relentlessly if they want to defeat their opponent.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature edition of the classic Bruce Maxwell game has been upgraded with new units, new scenarios, new terrain, new tables and new player aid cards. Additional enhancements introduced in this edition include:<br/><br/>&bull; Super-sized components feature 9/16&rdquo; counters and two game maps with larger hexes<br/>&bull; Game map information has been updated and includes all-new map artwork<br/>&bull; New units have been added, unit information has been updated and all units produced with new artwork<br/>&bull; Existing scenarios have been updated and two new scenarios added<br/>&bull; Orders of Battle are provided for all Scenarios both 1983 and 1988, allowing players to see the impact of the Reagan Era rearmament programs<br/>&bull; The game system has been redesigned and the new rules include extensive illustrations, examples of play and Designer&rsquo;s Notes to aid clarity<br/>&bull; Each rules section now begins with a summary, allowing experienced players to skip many rules sections that embody classic game mechanics they already know<br/>&bull; Rules details and restriction have been summarized graphically in Player Aids for faster reference and easier play<br/>&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are provided for Scenario set up and Reinforcement charts<br/>&bull; A new set of Designer&rsquo;s Notes contain a wealth of historical information on what the West discovered after the Warsaw Pact collapsed and most of its members joined NATO.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>&bull; Complexity: 7 out of 10<br/>&bull; Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)<br/>&bull; Time Scale: 24 hours per turn<br/>&bull; Map Scale: 15 miles per hex<br/>&bull; Unit Scale: regiments, brigades, and divisions, abstract air and naval forces<br/>&bull; Players: one to four, best with two<br/>&bull; Playing Time: 3-8 hours depending upon scenario<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull; One Rules Booklet<br/>&bull; One Play Booklet with Scenarios &amp; Designer&rsquo;s Notes<br/>&bull; Two 22&quot; x 34&quot; Maps<br/>&bull; Four Counter Sheets (9/16&quot; size playing pieces)<br/>&bull; One WP Player Charts &amp; Tables Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Player Charts &amp; Tables Card<br/>&bull; One WP Sequence of Play Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Sequence of Play Card<br/>&bull; One Warsaw Pact Strategic Surprise Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; One Warsaw Pact Extended Buildup Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Strategic Surprise Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; One NATO Extended Buildup Reinforcement Schedule Card<br/>&bull; Two 6-Sided Dice<br/>&bull; One Game Box and Lid<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BCXR6oDeCDxuZpUauim8KQ__thumb/img/InbYwnRBYW_fb-yw-K5pVWB2ETk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5397688.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BCXR6oDeCDxuZpUauim8KQ__original/img/BK2xLRIJ3QAZn7bdfE1YEtnnUJo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5397688.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Bruce S.

This is a sandbox-style game, and how you play is up to you!<br/><br/>In Floating World, you play as one of six unique characters from Edo Japan, each with a unique power and a mysterious secret. The game plays simultaneously over three phases that repeat until one player has gained a victory condition. All phases occur simultaneously, and they are:<br/><br/><br/>    The Draw Phase: Draw six cards from your deck, then pass them to another player. They take these cards, discard one of their choice, then separate the remaining five cards into two piles, one containing two cards and one containing three. You do the same for another player, then take your two piles, discarding one of them and playing the other.<br/>    The Collect Phase: Collect items and bonuses indicated on the cards in your hand. You may also pay time tokens to perform extra actions in the next phase.<br/>    The Action Phase: Simultaneously take actions based on your cards in hand and those that you chose in the collect phase. Disputes caused by the simultaneous nature of these actions are resolved using the influence track, where the player at the top of the track chooses the outcome; choosing in your own interest, however, drops you to the bottom of the track.<br/><br/><br/>Rounds continue in this way until a player gains any of the seven victory conditions available, such as collecting all four ganbaru tokens or discovering another player's secret location and achieving any two of the ganbaru tokens.<br/><br/>Philosophia: Floating World contains over 200 tarot-sized cards and 12 intricate miniatures and is filled with beautiful Ukiyo-e style Japanese art, all digitally remastered to regain the original vibrance of the era.

Witches, its last remaining practitioners, have always been outcasts and could help human society only in strict secrecy. The leader of their people, the Septima, has always been the wisest, most knowledgeable witch. Now, as her time is coming to an end, witches from all over the world gather at Noctenburg to leave their mark on the hostile town and prove to the Septima that they are her worthy successor.<br/><br/>Septima is a competitive, highly interactive strategy game of witchcraft. As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials. But beware: magic, even if used for good, invokes suspicion in the townsfolk...<br/><br/>Simultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima&rsquo;s central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.<br/><br/>Rescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players&rsquo; coven can end up in yours.<br/><br/>Accessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games&rsquo; most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Villő Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bern&aacute;t, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms.

By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.<br/>The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.<br/>Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.<br/><br/>Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/>Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.<br/><br/>Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.<br/><br/>The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.<br/><br/>There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.<br/><br/>Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.<br/><br/>There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ySf_0l6onvNDh1VPVEFsw__thumb/img/csCSyNHmOlYLDx0prqXu7VKvGAU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic767151.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ySf_0l6onvNDh1VPVEFsw__original/img/6cDiPs5s8NukYkPNtpp-Dxie8fk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic767151.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Alchemicus.pl","designer":"Andrzej Kurek","artist":"Paweł Klus","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.73506,"avgWeight":4.0667},{"bggId":1997,"name":"Zargo's Lords: Magic Duels for World Power","description":"The first fantasy wargame ever published in Italy.

Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.<br/><br/>In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their &quot;poor souls&quot; closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.<br/><br/>The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.<br/><br/>Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to &quot;sin&quot;. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game. If a player has burdened themselves with too much sin, though, all will ultimately be for naught.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yXU6z6pl-Kkn7KRUpiCKiw__thumb/img/rdeSRR98yXhlvfaprZbPjgTIQTE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3108106.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yXU6z6pl-Kkn7KRUpiCKiw__original/img/pzgU094wmqlD105xH7RkTvxbBcU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3108106.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Lion Rampant Imports","designer":"Rüdiger Kopf, Klaus Zoch","artist":"Franz Vohwinkel","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.18923,"avgWeight":3.0833},{"bggId":28678,"name":"Grand Conquest","description":"Grand Conquest is very similar to earlier versions of Donald Benge's Conquest.

The creatures already on the board progress towards the side of the board using a totally automatic way of moving. New creatures (1 to 3, depending on a dice roll) arrive on the board and start to progress too.<br/>     Preparation of the Action tiles.

The number of places available on the tiles depends on the number of players.<br/>     Choice of actions. Each druid team carries out 5 actions a round, represented by Action markers. Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).<br/>     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.<br/>     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs.

Players choose a mission which each has a different lengths and difficulty which maps out starting supplies, the win event and the structure between. Players travel on their selected mission through a series of regions. Each of these has a unique global effect for the area. Each turn, or day as we call it, each player draws an exploration card which causes them to make decisions, deal with random events or fight in battles. Battles are a large portion of the game since you will deal with them on the way to and during a warlord battle or most end events. During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage. This process repeats until one side or the other has been destroyed. When you win a battle you take the due rewards which can be used to trade for additional ship upgrades or crew members.

It is about an initiation trial where you and your fellow initiates have to prove that you are worthy of your tribe's legendary animal's, the Jaguar's power.<br/><br/>The Jaguar was the defender of the tribe in the ancient times, but on a fateful day it got struck by a terrible curse and was broken into crystal shards.<br/><br/>The Shards of the Jaguar are still to be found in the Sacred Temple among the mountains, and the initiation trial is about to seek them and incorporate their power. But your journey will not be that easy. The temple is filled with perilous traps, and you have to learn how to use them, if you want to acquire the Jaguar&rsquo;s hunting instinct.<br/><br/>Try to foresee what the others will do and set clever traps against them. Collect precious crystal shards, mystical amulets and map pieces leading to the Heart of the Jaguar. Outsmart the others and be the best in this trial to become the heir of the Jaguar, the defender of the tribe!<br/><br/>Shards of the Jaguar has eight rounds, and in each round, each player sets a trap secretly (Poisonous Gas/Darts/Guards/Earthquake), and then each player moves their character in the temple spending action points. You can move, take crystal shards, perform rituals and heal yourself in your turn for the action points. But move carefully! Each space on the game board could contain a secret trap - activated by another player - so you have to pay attention to each other's movements to be able to find out which traps will be activated and so which spaces are safe for that round.<br/><br/>After each player spent their action points, you activate the traps and check who got hit by them (gathering different negative effects). If you were able to hit another player with your trap, you get glory points, as you are worthy of the Jaguar's hunting instinct. At the end of the game you count the points you get for the crystal shards, the glory points for the successful traps, and the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gIxDP9rgwUExtMDG90LJ9A__thumb/img/l6ykR8q8u29gyIDNmEUaWBZgn2c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6436336.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gIxDP9rgwUExtMDG90LJ9A__original/img/wwqG15uR8MoD2_w-m7uoPQ5hpBY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6436336.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Clevergreen Board Games","designer":"Nagy Balázs","artist":"Herendi-Hárshegyi Judit","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":8.20786,"avgWeight":3.25},{"bggId":2494,"name":"Hispania","description":"Hispania gives four to five players a chance to re-enact this dramatic period of history.

General MacArthur still favored the more westerly route through the Philippines and had support amongst the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It took several conferences and nearly a year before the decision was made. There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement. With all these reasons, a battle for the Marianas was inevitable.<br/><br/>On 15th June 1944 71,000 American Marines and Infantry attempted to make the plan work. 32,000 dug-in Japanese attempted to stop them.<br/><br/>Saipan &ndash; The Bloody Rock will be the first game to utilize the new Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 2 maps.

An excellent large battle you can play over one sitting.<br/><br/>Shattered Jewels - This scenario covers a single day of fighting and revolves around the largest Banzai attack of the war. Thousands of Japanese attack the 105th Regiment near the town of Tanapag. Variable length but usually 4-5 turns.<br/><br/>The Battle for Saipan &ndash; The full historical campaign from 15th June- 9th July (224 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Saipan in 1944, from the first invasion at Charan Kanoa in the south, through the long bloody fight in the central mountains around Mount Tapotchao and finally to the last Japanese stand in the north.<br/><br/>Bloody Rock &ndash; This is a hypothetical campaign game that lets the players decide how to defend Saipan and how to invade it.

That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.<br/><br/>There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.<br/><br/>This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games.

Because being at war is expensive, it is often wiser to resort to plots and lies. Sometimes, making empty promises at the negotiating tables is better than getting involved in a risky and exhausting war, which may empty the treasury and expose you to losing precious prestige. The players have to pay extra attention to the dissenters who, especially in the beginning of the game, have greater military power and will not hesitate to draw others into a religious war. Will you manage to create an enormous colonial empire, military European dominion, or a territorially small but economically strong country? The players&rsquo; choices, luck, and reactions of others will affect the struggle. Creating an empire requires good strategic sense and a flexible approach to changing military and economic situations. The players have to forge thoughtful alliances and avoid wars which they may not win.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to create the most powerful empire.

The game is set in 1580 and covers the following 120 years, allowing the players to develop the city how they think is better. They can promote commerce with Spain, constructing a Harbor, and creating many productive buildings, or in another way, they can promote the construction of the biggest city buildings like the Cathedral, the Fort or the Cabildo. They can chase the richness, try to build an army or try to collaborate with the Church. They can link their policy to some famous city character, which will push a specific skill.

That was two centuries ago.<br/><br/>Now the barons and the princes swear loyalty to whichever claimant-emperor garrisons the nearest army today.

To play one card, you discard others. (Like Race for the Galaxy) These cards can be very powerful, but they can also be stolen by spies. The whole landscape of the game can change in the blink of an eye as ownership of a card changes hands.

The southern beachhead would be secured in only 2 days and the Americans were well established inland. With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 &mdash; heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler. This roughly regimentally sized unit raced ahead of the main force with the objective of capturing the main route of escape for the German Army. The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont&eacute;limar. They were to hold until relieved. The Germans would throw everything they could at Task Force Butler in a race to return to Germany before the larger Allied Formations coming up from the south and east would join Task Force Butler.<br/><br/>In the end, both sides could claim victory &mdash; the Allies mauled the enemy forces with the Germans suffering 2100 casualties with several thousand soldiers and large amounts of heavy equipment unable to escape.

From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant&rsquo;s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.<br/><br/>Historically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this &lsquo;victory&rsquo; cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.<br/><br/>As Abraham Lincoln quipped, &ldquo;Mr. Early, you are late.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early&rsquo;s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn&rsquo;t solve it &ndash; can you?<br/><br/>To Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.<br/><br/>The Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years. Above all, Line of Battle is designed to capture the free-for-all nature of an American Civil War battle in a fun, fast, and very playable format.<br/><br/>Scenarios: To Take Washington includes twelve scenarios, with one entry point for the full two-battle Campaign Game.

The major varieties of Preference are Croatian, Austrian, and Russian and there are variations of each as well.  Generally a three player game, a fourth player can play by having the dealer of each hand sit out for the round.  Following is a brief description of the Croatian version of the game, and below are links to rule sets for the Croatian, Austrian, and Russian versions.<br/><br/>Each of the suits has a predetermined value:<br/>Leaves = 2<br/>Bells = 3<br/>Hearts = 4<br/>Acorns = 5<br/><br/>The dealer deals out all 32 cards - 10 to each player and 2 to the &quot;talon&quot; (crib).  Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the &quot;talon&quot; and discards two, and then must take 6 tricks to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and &quot;kontra&quot; may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be &quot;rekontra&quot; and &quot;sukontra&quot; or doubled and doubled again and again!).<br/><br/>The players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.  Tricks taken when opposing a contract score some points for the player and against those players in the final tally.  <br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DYvi1pJoUi7gsf4u0bha4g__thumb/img/Hw5AvvZBH0M_fkymXtkf5wWnKVg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic100613.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DYvi1pJoUi7gsf4u0bha4g__original/img/DJAObyhdVm1kDWuds0A85o2aO4o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic100613.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1802,"publisher":"(Public Domain)","designer":"(Uncredited)","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":7.60306,"avgWeight":3.3529},{"bggId":97377,"name":"Hail Caesar: Battles with Model Soldiers in the Ancient Era","description":"Battles with model soldiers in the Ancient and Medieval eras.

The vast majority of Austrians cheer the Anschluss of their country by the German Reich. Central Europe is falling into Nazi hands and all the best European scientists will soon compete under the aegis of Heinrich Himmler, for whom no scheme is too wild or too improbable &mdash; but which team has the imagination, the courage, and the drive to most successfully accomplish their goals?<br/><br/>Secret Weapons of the Third Reich is a game for one to four players simulating the arms race of World War II from the German perspective. From secret submarine bases in Greenland to the mysterious Base 211 in Neuschwabenland, Antarctica, this game recreates the incredible tales of Nazi technology, from the famous V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets to the unlikely flying saucers derived from the work of Nikola Tesla. Will players be able to deliver the Haunebu project to completion? Will Hans Kammler escape with his last battalion of flying saucers to the dark side of the moon? Will the secret submarine fleet sail to Antarctica to pursue the war after the war? Or could German scientists produce an atomic bomb to be dropped on New York by an electro-gravitational flying saucer or within the warhead of a futuristic intercontinental V-3? Would it even be possible to build a huge solar satellite gun to strike America?<br/><br/>In the game, each player controls one or more research groups, each working on a secret weapon project. Each research group has a leading researcher, who provides an initial bonus (expressed in resource cubes or scientist cylinders) when the project is assigned. The researcher has a regime loyalty value that measures both the ability to make requisition attempts and the ability to resist opposing attempts.<br/><br/>A player tries to get their projects approved, then completed. Certain requirements (resource cubes and/or scientist cylinders and technologies attached to projects) must be met and costs paid in order to reach the stage of development of a project. Each turn, approved projects generate specific amounts of resource cubes as funding. Completed projects award victory points (VP) and allow, in most cases, weapon production. Produced weapons award VP to the owning player in addition to helping to achieve a cooperative goal for all players. In fact, if together the players fail to reach a certain number of weapons produced by the end of the game, they all lose. The weapon production goal varies depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>Play begins in 1938, one year before the outbreak of world war. At the start, players can only place research groups for their approved projects (project plants) in the portion of the map representing Germany and Austria. In 1939 and later, the conquests of Nazi Germany allow players to deploy their project plants in occupied European territories &mdash; but players will have to pay attention to the various locations because some areas allow only research and development, others only weapon production, and still others only research and development for U-Boat projects.<br/><br/>Also, players must operate in a &quot;state of warfare&quot;. This means that as time goes on they are more and more subject to enemy bombardments that can cause a great loss of resources and technologies. In addition, as starting in 1943 Allied and Soviet advances on Berlin make the map progressively smaller, players must face logistical issues never encountered during the early years of the war.<br/><br/>Should a completed project or produced weapon fall into Allied hands, players not only lose VP, but the weapons production goal recedes as well! Thus a certain amount of player cooperation is a must. Each player must balance his personal interests with the common need to share technologies and resources in order to fulfill the common goal.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, via events one player may secretly become the turncoat, working in the shadows to help the enemy, and winning the game if all players would otherwise lose.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zvLRlk1YxIyXOyuuKBq76w__thumb/img/p9jvb4AVkKQ99oaijBSJ8q9hGkk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3165758.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zvLRlk1YxIyXOyuuKBq76w__original/img/gFrkC9bZZ3WTtUYS1uDZeBoNYhA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3165758.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"4Dados","designer":"Luca Cammisa","artist":"Luca Cammisa","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3],"avgRating":6.89566,"avgWeight":4.3333},{"bggId":189506,"name":"Fallen Angel","description":"<a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asteriagames/fallen-angel-0/description?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asteriagames/fallen-ang...</a><br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FallenAngelTheBoardGame/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/FallenAngelTheBoardGame/</a><br/><br/>Fallen Angel is a game integrating dice-worker placement and area-majority scoring as its core mechanism, seamlessly matched with a steampunk fantasy theme.<br/><br/>The game is played in four rounds.

You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.<br/><br/>Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns.

These houses replaced small farm and monastery production in leading the evolutionary process of champagne, and by planting more vineyards or buying grapes from other producers or both, they mastered the specialization. To promote their product, the houses hired sales agents to take samples of their champagne wines to the Royal Courts of Europe, a crucial factor in generating the glamorous fashion of drinking champagne.<br/><br/>Despite production growth, improved quality, and increasing popularity, trade did not reach spectacular rates during the 19th century &mdash; which is why the game Dom Pierre is much more about winning prestige than earning money.

At the night of solstice, they brought an unexpected end upon the world, precisely by the rules they had foretold. Anything that people could imagine happened on that night. During that tragic spectacle, the Masters of Brilliance separated wheat from chaff, taking the chosen ones to a new nice little hell they had built in a higher dimension somewhere at the doorstep of afterlife. No one knows how they got there or how they managed to affect reality. Anyway, only rigorous cooperation could grant them enough power.<br/><br/>The end of the world brought about by these wise guys was not as perfect as they had planned. Soon it turned out that some men left in the ashes of the past world could enter the realm of the Masters of Brilliance. Perhaps the power they cast upon the world to destroy it left a solid print? Or perhaps the transition was not that difficult?<br/><br/>The first man to discover he possessed this ability was Jonas Arvani. When he found out he was not the only one, he founded a guild. The boarding ability &ndash; that is, the ability to jump into a much higher plane, where the Masters of Brilliance have their twisted utopia &ndash; soon turned into an enormous business. Not everyone managed to follow the guild's strict rules. Therefore competitive undertakings began to appear that were less able and less honest. Now retrievers have been trained by guilds to steal inventions and devices from the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance. Those items become artifacts in the ruined world. The most valuable prizes are schematics that allow mankind to recreate lost devices, so that they can serve people again.<br/><br/>In the board game Enclave: Zakon Krańca Świata, each player starts with a retriever card along with the machine that boosts their boarding ability. During the game, which lasts six turns, players are allowed to:<br/><br/><br/>    Upgrade their retriever (mental and physical condition)<br/>    Upgrade their jump machine (sarcophagus and sesame)<br/>    Buy items to protect themselves from deadly traps in the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance<br/>    Buy medication needed to heal their mental damage and physical wounds<br/>    Boarding the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance to find valuable prizes and knowledge<br/>    Do the job for the &quot;Shepherd&quot; without any risk, but with fewer profits<br/>    Visit the oracle to peek at the future and gain initiative in the next turn<br/>    Use the character or location card on the path &quot;to the tree&quot;<br/><br/><br/>This path is the main way to victory, known as becoming &quot;the chosen of the Tree&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Dwunastu przyw&oacute;dc&oacute;w religijnych zwanych Mistrzami Blasku zyskało wielkie wpływy oraz mn&oacute;stwo wyznawc&oacute;w, aby w noc przesilenia niespodziewanie wywołać koniec świata dokładnie według przepowiedzianych przez siebie reguł.<br/><br/>Właściwie stało się wszystko, co tylko ludzie zdołali sobie wyobrazić. A podczas tego dramatycznego spektaklu Mistrzowie Blasku odsiewali ziarno od plew. Zabierali wybranych, żeby zbudować im nowe, miłe piekiełko w wyższym wymiarze. Gdzieś w takim przedsionku do zaświat&oacute;w. Nie wiadomo, jak zdołali się tam dostać ani jakim sposobem potrafili wpływać na rzeczywistość. W każdym razie odpowiednią moc mogli uzyskać wyłącznie dzięki ścisłej wsp&oacute;łpracy.<br/><br/>Koniec świata pan&oacute;w mądrali nie był tak perfekcyjny, jak można by się spodziewać. Wkr&oacute;tce okazało się, że niekt&oacute;rzy z ludzi pozostawionych własnemu losowi na zgliszczach minionego świata potrafią przenikać do rzeczywistości Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku. Może moc, kt&oacute;rą Mistrzowie Blasku tchnęli w świat, żeby go rozwalić, zostawiła jakiś trwały ślad? A może przejście po prostu nie jest takie trudne? Pierwszym człowiekiem, kt&oacute;ry odkrył u siebie te niezwykłe zdolności, był Jonas Arvani. Niedługo potem przekonał się, że nie jest jedyny i założył gildię.<br/><br/>Umiejętność dokonywania abordaży, to znaczy skok&oacute;w w wyższy wymiar, w kt&oacute;rym Mistrzowie Blasku zbudowali swoją kaleką utopię, stała się wkr&oacute;tce wielkim biznesem. Gildia miała twarde zasady, kt&oacute;rym nie każdy m&oacute;gł podołać. Zaczęły powstawać konkurencyjne ugrupowania, mniej sprawne i mniej uczciwe.<br/><br/>Zadaniem pozyskiwaczy czy też szkolonych w gildii grabieżc&oacute;w jest wykradanie z enklawy Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku wynalazk&oacute;w i urządzeń, kt&oacute;re w zrujnowanym świecie zyskiwały rangę artefakt&oacute;w.

For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war with the US, from the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34&quot;) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts.<br/><br/>The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' &quot;Pacific War.&quot;<br/><br/>The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.<br/><br/>The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's &quot;Pacific War.&quot; Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat. Thus the game still feels like the original in those two aspects.<br/><br/>The game comes with the grand campaign and some small introductory battle scenarios.<br/><br/>Booklets:<br/><br/>    Rulebook I (rule 1.0 to 25.0)<br/>    Rulebook II (rule 26.0 to 62.0)<br/>    Scenarios &amp; Campaign reinforcements<br/>    Examples of Play, Optional Rules &amp; Designer's Notes<br/>    Chartbook I<br/>    Chartbook II<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ovV4lF-Sc5dWBKaIzWV5Wg__thumb/img/Xe-SL6Y7JW-yeGy0I4lfeQ8R2TY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic124607.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ovV4lF-Sc5dWBKaIzWV5Wg__original/img/FwrdtORDGCKPZpTUes7tEvdacCk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic124607.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Decision Games (I)","designer":"Kevin Kiff","artist":"Tom Willcockson","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,6,null],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.63448,"avgWeight":4.7857},{"bggId":188124,"name":"Ostroleka 26 maja 1831","description":"Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 covers the battle of Ostrołęka, one of the largest engagements of Poland&rsquo;s November Uprising. It was fought between Polish army commanded by general Jan Skrzynecki and Russian army commanded by field marshal Ivan Diebitsch. The battle was the final part of the operation of Polish army against Russian Imperial Guard. The meeting near Ostrołęka was a bit suprising for both sides, especially for Poles who didn&rsquo;t expect such quick appearance of Russian forces near their positions. Polish army was divided into two parts. The first part was situated on the eastern bank of the river Narew. The second, larger part was put on the western bank of the river. In Ostrołęka there were two bridges connecting both banks of the river (one of them was pontoon bridge).<br/><br/>The first part of the battle was fought on the eastern bank of Narew. Polish forces tried to slow down an assault of Russians and withdraw to the western bank. Unfortunately, in consequence of earlier orders, one of Polish infantry brigades commanded by general Bogusławski was stayed to defend town Ostrołęka (situated on the eastern bank of the river), and there attacked by overwhelming Russians and partially routed, partially destroyed. Russians took control over Ostrołęka at noon. Then some Russian grenadier battalions decided to cross the river through the bridges to create a bridgehead for further operations. So started the second part of the battle. Polish main army began attacks to destroy Russian bridgehead and both brigdes to prevent main body of Russian army to cross the river. There were few attacks. At first they were not properly coordinated. Russian small forces on the bridgehead was supported by powerful artillery situated on the eastern bank of the river which was higher than western bank and allowed crossing fire (Russians formed two great batteries, one to the north and one to the south of Ostrołęka, and were shooting over own units on the western bank).<br/><br/>In the later afternoon Polish attacks became more coordinated. Russians tried to gain more terrain, but it moved them out of the range of their supporting artillery and encouraged Polish army to make last, most powerful attack, which was stopped near to the river. The battle ended a famous charge of Polish horse artillery battery commanded by lt. col. J. Bem, which caused great chaos in the Russian forces and discouraged Russians to make general cavalry attack on Polish army in the end of the battle as they were used to do in the Napoleonic Wars. When battle ended, both sides had similar casualties (about 6 000 killed, wounded etc.). The battle is considered Polish army defeat because it left the battlefield and during the night and the next day started retreat, not chased by Russians who first weren&rsquo;t sure they had won. The main effect of the battle for Poles was the fall of morale of soldiers and the upper command, which allowed Russians to take initiative in the later part of Polish-Russian War.<br/><br/>Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 contains three scenarios, with one made to introduce players to the system and two historical ones, showing both parts of the battlle. The game is quite complex, tending to show full spectrum of tactic of the Napoleonic and Post-Napoleonic period, but in reasonably easy way. Basic game mechanic is similar to Igo/Ugo movement, but with two phases of movement: for cavalry and infantry, and two combat phases: for cavalry and infantry. Horse artillery is generally attached to cavalry and foot artillery is attached to infantry. Additional rules offer another movement systems but rather designed for further battles based on this rules, not for that one. Rules offer many possible reaction activities for non-active player during opposite player phase. Another rules feature is an unique combat calculation system based on traditional odds ratio but originally modified. The rules focuse on simulating cooperation of three kinds of weapon (infantry, cavalry and artillery) on the battlefield and showing different formations (column, line, square, skirmish, buildings defense). The playing time varies depending on the scenario, from 2-3 hours to whole day. It also depends on the players &ndash; the longest scenario can be finished very quickly by autowin.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- One mapsheet 96 x 68 cm <br/>- Nine sheets of die-cut counters (978 counters totally, most of them are markers)<br/>- One sheet of additional counters<br/>- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)<br/>- Three dices (D6)<br/>- Six sheets with tables and player aids<br/>- One sheet with units tables (alternative way of marking units loses)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dYEBKjd4n6QFnw7L2f5AYQ__thumb/img/BXytuQA59ot9VctVBhSjVKZc9tM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760503.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dYEBKjd4n6QFnw7L2f5AYQ__original/img/uc8OYsubVWOfxtq5xeimSBQhbmw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2760503.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Instytut Wydawniczy Erica","designer":"Ryszard Kita","artist":"Anna Andrzejewska-Godecka, Szczepan Atroszko, Wojciech Dąbrowski","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4,null],"goodPlayers":[1,3],"avgRating":8.94706,"avgWeight":4.1818},{"bggId":240901,"name":"A Time for Trumpets: The Battle of the Bulge, December 1944","description":"&quot;A Time for Trumpets&quot; (ATFT) is a battalion level wargame of the Battle of the Bulge.

With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.<br/><br/>The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state.

Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.<br/><br/>The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.<br/><br/>The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  <br/>Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:<br/><br/>&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.<br/>&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army<br/>&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles <br/>&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.<br/>&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.<br/><br/>The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units.

Rome is at the height of it&rsquo;s power, but is overextended in the face of both internal divisions and external challengers. Jews zealously protect their spiritual heritage from a rapidly spreading sect, and chafe under the thumb of an increasingly oppressive Rome. The Coalition struggles to survive beset by relentless Roman expansion, harsh environments, and confusing beliefs which threaten the old ways.

The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.<br/><br/>Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.<br/><br/>Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.<br/><br/>Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.<br/><br/>(source: Legion Games website)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aFilOR8T8scff45ypyDcpA__thumb/img/INL2Lj3UOm--rRNVsbHTDsbibdk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2002153.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aFilOR8T8scff45ypyDcpA__original/img/Gg4uJ46XQLoldPVffleLYf959MM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2002153.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Legion Wargames LLC","designer":"Didier Rouy","artist":"Didier Rouy","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":7.80299,"avgWeight":3.1667},{"bggId":202265,"name":"Chicago & NorthWestern","description":"American Robber Barons look to exploit America's midwest in this collusive game of explosive railroad expansion in the late 1800s.

Over 35,000 men belonging to 1st Allied Airborne Army dropped from the skies of Holland. Their objective: capture and hold a highway. The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.<br/><br/>The 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.<br/><br/>The four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase. All the activities of each formation are completed before those of another are begun. Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities. Those variables create the framework within which the players operate.<br/><br/>Optional rules focus on hidden movement and multi-player variations, as well as giving the Allied player the opportunity to execute his own operational plan.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n-oxN7bOguLiD_saH7B5BA__thumb/img/TVczUjmUb9Bj5569GQLBVSsF2q0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic458193.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n-oxN7bOguLiD_saH7B5BA__original/img/AzNxDvKk2f9wK6GyJTiUbiLGiiA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic458193.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"Decision Games (I)","designer":"J.

News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.<br/><br/>As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.<br/><br/>In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.<br/><br/>_____________<br/><br/>In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!<br/><br/>The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.<br/><br/>Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.<br/><br/>Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.<br/><br/>After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;<br/><br/>The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.<br/><br/>Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.<br/><br/>The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cKUoMYgdqzpWCk1tD6ih5w__thumb/img/mwSIy9WLBQr6ZXviQTQVmbOBkuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2318552.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cKUoMYgdqzpWCk1tD6ih5w__original/img/_3zEwCx-jtWhEYxuzC7MX2rOmYY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2318552.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Jonathan Pac Cantin Games","designer":"Jonny Pac","artist":"Don Aguillo","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":7.29803,"avgWeight":3.5455},{"bggId":189351,"name":"Virus","description":"A frightening virus, Virus Q, is spreading in the major cities of the planet.

There are those who want to take advantage of the chaos and terror in order to gain power and establish a new form of government, trying to maneuver and control the monsters generated by the virus. A cure would ruin their plans forever.<br/><br/>The virus was created in a secret military lab, in a space that's practically inaccessible. Inside, Virus Q spread for the first time, accidentally, maybe; the creatures that now inhabit the Lab are difficult even to imagine...<br/><br/>In the innovative lab crawler game Virus, players are the team that infiltrates the Lab looking for the antidote to Virus Q. They will collect the few and fragmentary bits of information scattered in the laboratory, avoiding or fighting the monsters that populate it.<br/><br/>The map generation and the movement/placement of monsters depends on the player actions with a semi-automatic mechanism controlling what takes place where. The fighting requires some dexterity elements as well as players must plan their tactics by combining their shooting power with available movement, achieving successes by rolling cubes.<br/><br/>Also, the game takes place in real time!<br/><br/>In sum, you can play Virus cooperatively, semi-cooperatively or competitively.

Your first task will be to seek out and discover the great Indian cities and empires -- which may appear in their historical locations, or in quite different places. Once you discover where the cities and empires are, it is time to gather gold. You might battle and plunder the Indians, or your best plan may be to attempt diplomacy and enlist them as allies -- especially if you have an Indian interpreter in your expedition. Like Francisco Pizarro, you might try a Sudden Shock Attack to capture a native king and extort a fat ransom. Always you must be sure to keep the Governor happy, or he may issue a warrant for your arrest. Beware of native uprisings, painted warriors, and poisoned darts around the next corner, and watch out for defection in your own ranks. If you fall behind in the race for gold, you might try to descend the Amazon or discover the Fountain of Youth. And when you are really in a tight place, perhaps you can appeal to Mano de Dios (the Hand of God) to bail you out.<br/><br/>The Conquistadors is playable by from 1 to 5 players, with an introductory Basic Game, a more involved Standard Game, and some optional rules.

In doing so, the bustling guilds both have an eye on the other guilds and the dreaded Circumdate Caelo Trust, which also lays claim to this region and does not shy away from using military means.<br/><br/>Players assume control over a steam guild and explore the newly opened region for natural resources, gaining crystal and ore samples, and building new mines to exploit the land. The government of Tharos awards different medals for the players&rsquo; services, which increase the influence of their steam guilds with the player ideally winning enough influence to take over as leader of their guild.<br/><br/>Tharos is a &ldquo;Dice-Bag-Building&rdquo; game, where dice represent actions and their respective strengths. The dice are used on the player boards and for activation and usage of the player cards. Additionally, each player has a deck of cards that could substantially help them achieve their goals.<br/><br/>The game plays over the course of four rounds with four turns per round. The &quot;game board&quot; consists of a 4x4 grid formed by the 16 region cards. After setup, one player reveals the top attack card. Afterwards the players determine the transformer effect. Now each player draws dice out of their bag (normally 5) and rolls them.

Raicer, The Fall of the Third Reich covers the dramatic last two years of WWII in Europe, as the Western Allies and the Soviet Union fight against fierce German resistance to bring down the Thousand-Year Reich.<br/><br/>The time is July, 1943. From the beaches of Sicily to the plains of central Russia, millions of men are poised to decide the fate of Europe and bring about the end of WWII...<br/><br/>Two large hex maps cover Europe from France to Central Russia, and Leningrad to Sicily. Units are Armies, Corps, and in a few cases, Divisions. There are twelve two-month turns.<br/><br/>Those turns play quickly, and yet there is a lot of subtlety within each one, with rules for both reaction and exploitation. Getting the most out of the various movement segments is essential for both players: as the Axis for plugging gaps in the front line, and as the Allies for exploiting every last opportunity to move ever further into the Third Reich proper. But the German player will quickly learn that a passive defense is doomed to fail, and that selective counterattacks are vital to hold the enemy at bay.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for Soviet and German Command (Stavka), while the effects of Hitler's increasing interference in military affairs is presented through a rule which requires the German player to use OKW (West Front Headquarters) or OKH (East Front HQ) to be able to retreat infantry units from an enemy ZOC.<br/><br/>While the Soviets and Germans begin the game locked in a death struggle at Kursk, the Allies face the early dilemma of where to invade, with a choice of invasion sites ranging from Holland to Greece. Knock Italy out of the war or Second Front Now! in Northwest Europe: the choices are yours.<br/><br/>Supply rules have been kept as simple as possible, while still modeling the historic importance of logistics. The Western Allies in particular will learn the importance of ports in supplying their armies, and have to base their strategy around them.<br/><br/>Perhaps most significantly, the game effectively models the Strategic Air War over Europe with only a few simple rules and a handful of counters. But though easy to learn, this &lsquo;game within a game&rsquo; can have a dramatic impact upon the course of the war, as the Allies must prioritize their air resources while the Luftwaffe struggles both to slow the Allied air offensive and support the German armies in the field. The challenges are numerous and subtle.<br/><br/>Other rules cover variable (and degrading) German troop strength,  Allied Airborne drops, Strategic Transit, Forts, Yugoslav Partisans, and Axis Minor Powers, including Italian Surrender<br/><br/>The game can be played by two (Axis and Allied/Soviet) or three players (Axis, Allied and Soviet) but also works well solo. The Fall of the Third Reich is a game of large scope and nail-biting decisions, combining fidelity to history with a fun playable game system.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Product Information<br/>Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months<br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 30 miles<br/>Unit Scale: Armies, Corps and some Divisions<br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played well with 3 players or solitaire<br/>Playing Time: 6-10 hours<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/msxl3RTalmAdgj3PNSBC-w__thumb/img/UNYtvraX5PeY1WcgscWBYyB-PgE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3248854.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/msxl3RTalmAdgj3PNSBC-w__original/img/bjIrsyYvYzIo0BKKPHcXsFnooYI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3248854.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Ted Raicer","artist":"François Vander Meulen, Michael Monfront","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,null],"avgRating":7.79667,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":233590,"name":"Triora: City of Witches","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Triora is a &quot;Euro&quot; style game where each player will play as a Witch, in the Italian city of Triora, trying to achieve vengeance against the city that burned their leader.

Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.<br/><br/>The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game.

It was a complex war that involved diverse interests and troops from many nations. Great Britain sent her troops to defend Portugal, within the context of the European Coalitions against France.  In Spain proper the war, which presented certain aspects of a civil war, saw an uneasy alliance of reformists and traditionalists under the name of &quot;Patriots&quot; facing the puppet King Jose I Bonaparte and the occupation army; composed mainly of French but also of Italians, Neapolitans, Poles, Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Spaniards (known as &quot;Juramentados&quot;).<br/><br/>Spaniards, British and Portuguese form the Allied side while France and her allies and satellites form the Imperial side.

Speed - but not reckless haste - is the key to success.<br/><br/>On 25th April 1915, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, launched a hastily assembled force of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops against the Turkish defenses on the Gallipoli peninsula. Their goal was to capture the forts that guarded the Dardanelles. With that achieved, the British and French Fleets would sail to Constantinople, topple the Ottoman government, and open up a supply line to Russia. However, defending the beaches was an equal number of Turkish divisions, hardened in the recent Balkan Wars, led by well-trained Turkish officers, supported by advisors from the German General Staff.<br/><br/>An hour before dawn, in complete silence, the Anzacs rowed ashore at Ari Burnu, a place later to be famous as Anzac Cove. The Royal Navy had landed them in the wrong place! Huge dirt cliffs and scrub-choked washouts confronted them, rather than a beach and low dunes. Nevertheless inland they went, overrunning the Turkish pickets, only to become hopelessly confused by the night landing, jigsaw terrain, and inexperience. Several miles inland, a gifted Turkish Officer, Mustafa Kemal, was reviewing his regiment after night maneuvers above Ari Burnu. Kemal's quick and furious counter-attack saved the day for the Ottomans, and set him on the path to become the founder of modern Turkey. Further south, at Cape Helles, the Lancashire Fusiliers won six Victoria Crosses - before breakfast - as they ripped through the barbed wire on the beach. The invaders never reached even their first day's objectives, although the Turks only avoided defeat by a hair's breadth. With a different plan, they might have thrown the invaders back into the sea.<br/><br/>The map scale is 400 metres per hex and covers the entire peninsula from north of Anzac Cove to Cape Helles, based on the 1922 British Ordnance Survey (i.e. from Anzac to Helles, including all the forts in between). Players can choose to land at the historical beaches, or create their own plans.<br/><br/>This wargame system emphasizes command and control. Players command by Brigade and Regiment. To be successful, a player must plan for the eventual exhaustion of their troops, rotating them out of line to rest and recover stragglers. The result is an accurate modeling of the tempo of these battles. Infantry combat is ranged rifle and MG fire, culminating in close assault. Artillery is powerful but ultimately limited. Shrapnel from the standard field guns is deadly against troops in the open, but only the rare howitzers firing high-angle HE can deal with trenches.

Drang Nach Osten! is a complete game of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/><br/>    Five 21 x 27&quot; mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).<br/>    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:<br/>    Two Europa sheet 1<br/>    One Europa sheet 2<br/>    Three Europa sheet 3<br/>    One Europa sheet 4<br/>    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)<br/>    One rules folder and cover.<br/>    One set of charts and tables consisting of:<br/>        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle<br/>        One Soviet Order of Appearance<br/>        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart<br/>        One German Initial Order of Battle<br/>        One German Order of Appearance<br/>        One German Units Appearing Chart<br/>        Two Combat Results Tables<br/>        One Unit Identification Chart<br/>        One Time Record Chart<br/>        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>Each hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZT3G4RzxwqR4MRBCgWX0Rg__thumb/img/VrZH3OSgkBKdSg20alHHiIVyHRQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5557237.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZT3G4RzxwqR4MRBCgWX0Rg__original/img/aA8gioa0TK_j29DPRxFNjDjlMCI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5557237.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1973,"publisher":"Game Designers' Workshop","designer":"Rich Banner, Frank Chadwick","artist":"Don Lowry","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4,null],"goodPlayers":[1,3],"avgRating":6.85517,"avgWeight":4.1818},{"bggId":35452,"name":"Lincoln's War","description":"Lincoln&rsquo;s War reflects the fickle nature of politics and its influence on military policy-making during the American Civil War. Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.<br/><br/>Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a president&rsquo;s vital political support. Immobilization tokens reflect damage in the form of casualties, as well as hesitation, confusion and even insubordination.<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War contains:<br/>    1 22&quot; x 34&quot; map<br/>    1 color rulebook<br/>    1 color play and background booklet<br/>    162 Operations Cards<br/>    2 countersheets<br/>    2 player aid cards<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War was designed by John Poniske with the assistance of Mike Joslyn, and features the artwork of Niko Eskubi and map artwork by Mark Mahaffey.<br/><br/>(source: MMP website)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1IDUlmDuw2BQBP5_khbbYg__thumb/img/q1GUenb9q7y3oSlK5OqkQFppELI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic978372.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1IDUlmDuw2BQBP5_khbbYg__original/img/04ea0VnibVLrWtxeL7MGNeyZ8lg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic978372.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Multi-Man Publishing","designer":"John Poniske","artist":"Nicolás Eskubi, Mark Mahaffey","honors":"2013 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee","bestPlayers":[2,4],"goodPlayers":[1,3],"avgRating":6.37569,"avgWeight":3.1579},{"bggId":251131,"name":"Point Blank: V is for Victory","description":"&quot;Point Blank&quot; is Lock 'n Load Publishing tactical World War 2 squad card wargame, for 2 players pitted against each other in situational combat scenarios.<br/><br/>There is also a solo option as well as partnerships in teams of 2.<br/><br/>Each scenario presents the players with a unique situation involving squads of men, support weapons, leaders, and individual armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>This game pits the forces of the USA against Germany just after the landings in Normandy (June 1944) through October 1944. Each player has victory conditions determined by the scenario in which to defend or take objectives, seek and destroy their opponent&rsquo;s units, or one of many other different scenario objectives.<br/><br/>The game is played on an abstract map board made up of terrain cards in the game and managed through a distance system that accounts for the range to targets, line of sight, and defensive attributes. The player has units that start out on the map and gradually work their way towards their objectives by advancing through the battlefield all the while conducting combat actions against their opponent or defending their troops from return fire or whatever hell that awaits them. Players draw cards from a common action deck where they will play actions on their units on the map board. The game is an IGOUGO impulse system and turns are managed when the action deck is exhausted. (Some scenarios may require multiple deck exhaustion to finish the game). Actions in the game consist of Fire, Move, Assault, Rally, etc. The action cards contain dice icons on them to determine random results.<br/><br/>One of the unique features of the game is that it contains a deck of terrain cards that are not part of the action deck. As players change terrain they will draw a terrain card in which their moving units will occupy. Some action cards such as Recon helps players manage what terrain they occupy but your opponent may have other plans for your moving troops during their turn.<br/> Combat in the game is similar to how combat is conducted in Lock n Load Tactical. 2 players can play a game in about an hour (depending on the scenario size) and if you cannot find an opponent then try the game solo system. In general, the gameplay is fast and excited and compares to such legendary game systems as Up Front.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qhRvLWTB-GKBD-p7JHtHAg__thumb/img/TOXA2e-_nhXc_HLvQiOLeTnDstY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6979640.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qhRvLWTB-GKBD-p7JHtHAg__original/img/0LQKPJidys52-E9P_hx5B8XZJ7Y=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6979640.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC.","designer":"Sean Druelinger","artist":"Blackwell Hird, Shayne Logan","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[null],"avgRating":8.41408,"avgWeight":3.5},{"bggId":7752,"name":"Over There","description":"A game of the 1918 campaigns on the Western and Italian Fronts during World War One, using units that are mostly divisions and brigades, with two-week turns, and maps at 16 miles per hex.

Players also need to construct and complete their mines and prospect for ore.<br/><br/>However, too much bribery leads to a decrease in reputation which affects a player&rsquo;s position at the end of the game, but limited access to the transport and shipping infrastructure will seriously impact a player&rsquo;s ability to make money.<br/><br/>Selecting the right time to ship and sell is the key, because the market can be manipulated by other players. The winner will be the player who can make loads of money while keeping a good market reputation.

By performing incredible miracles, unleashing epic combinations of monsters, and cleverly utilising their deity&rsquo;s unique power, players can find ingenious ways to give themselves a surprising edge.<br/><br/>A turn consists of choosing one of the following four actions:<br/><br/>Pilgrimage: move acolytes and followers from settlement to settlement. Along the way, your acolytes can preach to convert the resident population or fight off monsters to protect your following from the ill will of your rivals.<br/><br/>Spread the Word: place (or replace) a faith token to mark your growing cultural influence in the surrounding settlements. It will be far easier to construct temples if your religion is already deeply rooted in the region's culture.<br/><br/>Divine Intervention: perform a miracle by playing a card from your hand or choose a monster to summon from the cards available in the central area.

Once those resources are extracted, the Beta Bots' task is to deliver them to the corporation's ships.<br/><br/>It won't be a piece of cake. To start with, the exoplanet is unstable, so the Beta Bots will have to adapt to a constantly changing environment.  On top of that, each corporation ship requires different resources, and each payload delivery requires perfect timing &amp; alignment with the orbiting trajectory of the matching ship. And last, but not least, the rival corporation Cylindroids INC&reg; has sent its own bots to snatch resources and interfere with your bots.<br/><br/>But do not fret! Beta Bots can count on Alpha Bot&rsquo;s help, a support robot with a (very) short-tempered AI. Alpha Bot will unlock new places to mine, give the Beta Bots more actions and generally make their life easier...but keep an eye on those pesky Cylindroid bots, since they won't pass up the opportunity to damage your guardian!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Mechanical overview:<br/><br/>The game is organized in rounds. In each round, an event takes place (which might involve trouble for the Beta Bots!) and the players will program actions to interact with the planet's resource-laden chambers, with enemies, with Alpha Bot, or with each other. Actions are chosen in secret and players commit to them before any are revealed. The stress level of each bot determines the turn order as well as its possible resource deliveries. Then players take turns to reveal their programmed actions, and execute them.<br/><br/>Each player has their own robot's blueprint, where they store resources using multiple containers of limited size. Those resources can be delivered to the passing ships, or they can be transformed or spent to enhance the robot's capabilities.<br/><br/>During the adventure, the autonomous Alpha Bot will advance through the planet's chambers until it reaches the surface. Players can interact with Alpha Bot to obtain advantages or to steer it out of harm's way, since it is vulnerable to enemy attacks and the planet's adversities.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, there's a maintenance step that includes the activation of enemy robots (Cylindroids). They can move, attack, or occupy resource chambers. Additionally, players will receive benefits or penalties (stress) according to their distance to Alpha Bot.<br/><br/>The game ends when Alpha Bot reaches the last chamber. The players tally the victory points, which can be earned in different ways: Through successful resource deliveries, by upgrades on their robot, by fulfilling other objectives, etc. Then, each player's victory points is reduced by the amount of stress they incurred during gameplay, and the player with most remaining points wins the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZnmbL5is4SxhKk42iXDLsw__thumb/img/QvpKGKYd--cKzkudBeu-k7CgmfQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5741971.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZnmbL5is4SxhKk42iXDLsw__original/img/GzmRXMvqtjTu8xvlDYV8lYxHCxA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5741971.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"2Tomatoes Games","designer":"Fernando Barbanoj","artist":"Pedro A.

The War (&quot;TW&quot;) is a hex-and-counter strategic-level game which aims to provide the challenge of a monster game with the ease of play of a moderate complexity war game. Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games&rsquo; new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).<br/><br/>Although not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they&rsquo;re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG&rsquo;s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.<br/><br/>For the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn&rsquo;t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier&hellip;or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.<br/><br/>Although the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn&rsquo;t a simulation and isn&rsquo;t intended to be. It&rsquo;s a &quot;gamer&rsquo;s game&quot; with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right. Both realistic and playable, TW should present a rewarding challenge for any WWII strategy game buff.<br/><br/>Scenario List for The War: Europe 1939-1945:<br/><br/>    1939 Full War Campaign<br/>    1941 Campaign<br/>    1942-43 Turning Point Campaign<br/>    Poland 1939<br/>    Norway 1940<br/>    France 1940<br/>    Barbarossa 1941<br/>    North Africa 1941-43<br/>    The Atlantic Lifeline 1939-45<br/>    Bolshevik Hordes 1944-45<br/>    Regia Marina<br/>    D-Day to VE Day 1944-45<br/><br/><br/>Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)<br/>Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Good<br/><br/>Designer: Ernie Copley<br/>Developer: Paul Shackleton<br/>Artist: Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    2 maps<br/>    9 full sheets of 5/8&rdquo; counters<br/>    Approximately 20 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various displays, tracks, reminders, tables, charts, worksheets, etc.<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    1 scenario booklet<br/>    1 deck of variant cards<br/>    2 dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid &ndash; the big 3&rdquo; deep box<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S4c6z2o5WQpyBPg1OIl64Q__thumb/img/7v-kyWVO5NKozimJMdAMS7EdWsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1017633.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S4c6z2o5WQpyBPg1OIl64Q__original/img/FV3hceNPH--WiKvnRPhzQ4FWnVA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1017633.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Ernie Copley","artist":"Mark Mahaffey","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3,4,5],"goodPlayers":[1,null],"avgRating":7.22055,"avgWeight":4.0},{"bggId":195450,"name":"Navíos de Línea: Trafalgar 1805","description":"Ships of the Line is a naval combat system that simulates battles between 1740 and 1815 at the tactical level. &quot;Trafalgar 1805&quot; recreates the clash between the British fleet - commanded by Admiral Nelson - and the Spanish-French combined force - led by Admirals Villeneuve and Gravina - that took place on October 21st, 1805.<br/><br/>The plastic pieces represent the actual ships that fought the biggest pre WWII battle, excluding Lepanto.

The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.<br/><br/>The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.<br/><br/>Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.<br/><br/>Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too.

Level up your character with a wide range of unique skills and abilities. Play through six chapters of two huge campaigns spanning 25 years in the history of Skyrim in this endlessly replayable boardgame.<br/><br/>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim &ndash;  The Adventure Game is a 1-4 player co-operative game of adventure and exploration across Skyrim. Players take the roles of heroes involved in epic quests, working together to defeat their enemies and exploring the vast expanse of Skyrim. You will be able to choose character miniatures like the Khajiit, Nord, or High Elf; plan your strategy with weapons or spells; and fight your way through forgotten mines, Draugr-infested tombs, or ancient Dwemer cities to find ancient treasures and increase your power.<br/><br/>The players must keep an eye out as the threat increases across Skyrim as Dragons, Daedra, Trolls, and more roam the lands and wreak havoc across the holds. Players need to work together to keep the lands free, whilst balancing the demands of their most important quests.<br/><br/>The base game is divided into two campaigns of three chapters each. The decisions the players make from their first turn have a distinct effect on the unfolding story and encounters, making the whole campaign experience different every time you play. You can even save your progress after each game and start the next chapter with the same character, equipment, and skills.<br/><br/>With the numerous choices of characters, gear, magic, and skills matched with the many decisions each player makes through their quests, there are literally hundreds of hours of gameplay, with some stories not even seen based on your early decisions. The face of Skyrim can change during the game, impacting the course of the players' experience in subsequent chapters. At any time, the players can simply reset, choose another character and play style, make different choices, and experience things differently. Alternatively, pick a chapter that sounds fun and drop in to just play that adventure as a one-off.<br/><br/>Key mechanics:<br/><br/>A Living Board<br/>The game board represents the province of Skyrim. Players move their characters &mdash; represented by 32mm scale plastic miniatures &mdash; across the region, visiting Strongholds, exploring dungeons and meeting interesting characters as the story unfolds. But they are not the only ones there; roaming monsters appear, blocking roads and threatening the peace in Skyrim. Several game effects could lead to the fall of a Stronghold so players need to keep an eye on the state of unrest and the active dangers across the board.<br/><br/>Customizable Characters<br/>There are no classes in Skyrim. Each character has a different starting innate ability and additional abilities that are unlocked as they learn specific skills, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are tied to a gameplay style. For example, even though Nords shine when they are developed with a focus on warrior skills and equipment, a player could decide to make their Nord a spellcaster, or a summoner, and still retrain midway through the game after finding an amazing sword they really want to use. Players can change their progression path mid-game, and enjoy many different play styles.<br/><br/>Upgradeable Equipment<br/>There are plenty of equippable items: weapons, pieces of armor, trinkets, etc. Most of these items can be customized; by either Enchanting or Upgrading them in a Stronghold. When Upgrading or Enchanting an item, the player draws an Enchantment/Upgrade card, and slots it underneath the item, altering its properties. A piece of armor can be Upgraded so it becomes better against Heavy Attacks, for example, and it can also be Enchanted so it helps the character regenerate Stamina faster. When learning the Smithing and the Enchanting skills, the players get to draw more cards and choose between them, making the experience of customizing equipment richer and letting them focus on the playstyle they prefer. Furthermore, when playing in a group, one player can specialize their character in Enchanting or Smithing and upgrade all their allies' items by meeting in a Stronghold, adding another layer of cooperative gameplay.<br/><br/>Quests in Cards<br/>The story in the game is told using Quest cards. Players draw Main Quests &mdash; those that push the narrative forward &mdash; and Personal Quests &mdash; side stories gained by exploring the vastness of the province of Skyrim. By completing or failing them, the story progresses. Many of these Quests give the players a choice at the end. This choice chains the Quest with a new one, creating a branching story that changes every time the game is played. Failing a quest doesn&rsquo;t mean losing the game; instead, failure often becomes another way of choosing. The cards are organized in a way in which, if a card is removed as a result of Quest being failed or a game effect is triggered, the next card will take its place, dramatically changing the story.<br/><br/>Combat System<br/>With an assortment of weapons, ranging from daggers to bows, players will be able to engage in combat with dangerous enemies, whether they be in a dungeon or part of a questline. Each weapon and spell will inform the player what attacks it can perform and how much Stamina or Magicka they&rsquo;ll have to spend to use them. The player will roll the custom dice and attempt to overcome each weapon&rsquo;s specific Skill Tests; hitting with heavier weapons is bound to be harder than hitting with lighter weapons. Combat is fast, exciting, and deadly, although strategy is a key factor to success. Some enemies, in fact, will employ unorthodox tactics, including the ability to heal themselves or wear nearly impenetrable armors.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawling<br/>Players can visit increasingly dangerous caves, mines, tombs, ruins, and Dwemer cities across Skyrim. Dungeons are built with cards each representing a major threat in that area of the dungeon. It might be a terrifying Draugr or a surprise trap that, if you&rsquo;re lucky, one of the characters may be capable of disabling. As the characters level up, the lower-level adversaries are discarded, scaling the difficulty of the dungeons along with the player&rsquo;s level. The more you visit a certain type of dungeon, the more likely you will see its more fearsome denizens, albeit with better rewards!<br/><br/>Cooperative<br/>The whole game is fully cooperative. Players are encouraged to discuss their strategies and to collaborate to advance in their own storylines. Each player will be following their own storyline, joining together at the end of each chapter, when their plots are woven together into an epic finale for the whole party. <br/>There are some situations where characters, even if they have the same overall goal, find themselves on opposite sides of a struggle, and may interfere with each other as they progress. This gives an interesting layer of light competitive gameplay, whilst still keeping the cooperative nature of the game in the forefront.<br/> Expansions<br/>The Dawnguard expansion will add a third campaign with three additional chapters to play through, new characters, dungeon adversaries, treasures, events, and more. One of our expansions will make the Ghosts of the Blades haunt you throughout Skyrim during the first Campaign of the game and another threatens devastation to Skyrim in the form of a great dragon! There is much more to be revealed through the Gamefound campaign. The team has planned for a massive upgrade kit converting all the wandering monsters over to 32mm scale plastic miniatures which are all compatible in scale with the miniatures game The Elder Scrolls Call to Arms. More information will be revealed in the run-up to the launch of the board game<br/> <br/>All in all, the Elder Scrolls Skyrim Adventure Game will offer players dozens and dozens of hours of adventure exploring the game world. Expansions will ensure there&rsquo;s even more Skyrim to be had.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTa3H9kWaUjlrldh8qgYlg__thumb/img/1zvLGq6-VjjEAUBMuHIOrwlj_YU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7203331.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTa3H9kWaUjlrldh8qgYlg__original/img/BcTtFMEmCQ--xnSh4SYqSEYbhO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7203331.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Modiphius Entertainment","designer":"Javier Angeriz-Caburrasi, Juan Echenique, Stefano Guerriero, Rob Harris","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,4],"goodPlayers":[3,null],"avgRating":7.48615,"avgWeight":3.1429},{"bggId":25841,"name":"Le Grand Empire","description":"Le Grand Empire simulates the Napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 at a strategic level. Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.<br/><br/>The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.<br/><br/>The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.<br/><br/>At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.<br/><br/>The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.<br/><br/>Contents :<br/> * Two maps<br/> * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).<br/> * one rulebook and one scenarios booklet.<br/> * 2 dice.<br/> * Tables and charts<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zeR5J0JzR6ik0ejohAxohA__thumb/img/TGhsCJOPC1WlLEeqb2tsccOfjlw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic360061.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zeR5J0JzR6ik0ejohAxohA__original/img/mqVpt2n3IoGMvO0dnW-N9VCtdn0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic360061.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":7,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Pratzen Editions","designer":"François-Stanislas Thomas","artist":"Christophe Gentil-Perret","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4,5,6,7],"goodPlayers":[2,null],"avgRating":7.12091,"avgWeight":3.7},{"bggId":19418,"name":"Kings Progress","description":"From the producer's website:<br/><br/>After the success of City and Guilds, Steve's new game Kings Progress was inevitable.

The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.<br/><br/>The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.<br/><br/>The facts:<br/><br/><br/>     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.<br/>     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).<br/><br/><br/>The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.<br/><br/>In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.<br/><br/>In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Three 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps, <br/>560 playing pieces, <br/>rules, <br/>three scenario books, <br/>political events and charts.<br/><br/><br/>Note: <br/>The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. <br/> The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5ajV-d5xwUzMZodmXTws8A__thumb/img/W6D6B5culF0x2NuhkacCNiRGmqc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic237697.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5ajV-d5xwUzMZodmXTws8A__original/img/GOlC3Gsx1Mt-dwF9R64A7-ZJc10=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic237697.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2003,"publisher":"Avalanche Press Ltd.","designer":"Brian L.

You and your friends will assume the roles of corporations, competing to prepare Kaimas-2 (the first planet outside of our solar system capable of supporting human life) for a large-scale colonization effort. The corporation that contributes the most will become the market leader going forward!<br/><br/>The game includes three distinct game styles with the following victory conditions:<br/>​<br/><br/>     Basic Simulation &ndash; the first player to reach 7 Mission Stars wins.<br/>     Early Arrival &ndash; the last year is triggered when a player reaches 10 Mission Stars. The player with the most stars at the end of that year wins.<br/>     Planned Arrival &ndash; the player with the most Mission Stars after 5 years wins.<br/><br/><br/>To earn Mission Stars, you must expand your resource base and develop your crew with specific combinations of traits and classes. Unlike many euro style games where players focus on their own playing area and can only affect each other indirectly, Lander enables players to directly impact each other's strategies through various game mechanics, such as take that and variable player powers.<br/><br/>At it's core, Lander is a game of options. On any given turn, you'll have many potential directions to go in, which gives you a lot of flexibility in how you plan your strategy. It also enables you to pivot when something unanticipated happens (e.g. acid rain reduces the colony's food production, a rival corporation relocates one of your structures, the mission you were working towards gets completed just before you can grab it!). This means that no matter how bleak things may seem, there's almost always a way back in!<br/><br/>Unique leadership abilities and action cards can be used to pull back your opponents or further your own interests, while event cards will force you to make difficult choices that can impact yourself or the entire colony. Lander is like life. You will experience highs and lows and be faced with a series of challenges that will force you to solve problems and pivot your strategy. It's not meant to be easy (think Matt Damon in the Martian). You are self-interested corporations, struggling to survive on a foreign planet - don't be surprised if the planetary conditions change or your colleagues put something toxic in your soup.<br/><br/>While some orders in the game are commonly used across game styles and player counts, others are more situational. For example, negotiation provides a novel framework for trading resources and cards between corporations with the use of a timer and collateral. Typically, a 2-player game won't see any negotiation, but it can become very common in a 3 or 4-player game, especially if one player starts to pull away. Observations are often used sparingly in the first couple years, but can become quite strategic in later years, as you study your opponents' actions and try to time your moves just right.<br/><br/>Lander is a game that often requires a few plays for you to really start appreciating its depth. As you get familiar with the mechanics and cards, you'll start to see there is a game within a game, whereby the study of your opponents' actions is crucial for developing your own strategy. Similar to poker, players can study their opponents' hands, crew and orders to predict what they might be trying do. The interplay between reading your opponents, using your observations, bluffing and playing your action cards becomes the game within the game. Knowing how and when to employ these different tactics is of course, up to you to master...<br/><br/>Your story begins here!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LTNTIWaKIGaOmHmI7TlBkQ__thumb/img/3O-hgyL8z7N8qu5vKEuKU72kRAw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5059038.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LTNTIWaKIGaOmHmI7TlBkQ__original/img/1-755Ej1FAnlnqNyzOKsKACxWkY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5059038.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":0,"publisher":"Intrepid Games","designer":"Daniel Alexander (II), Sean Lemon","artist":"Elias Stern","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.45079,"avgWeight":3.3333},{"bggId":8056,"name":"Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942","description":"Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942, is a game covering the air, land, and sea battles between the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps and the forces of the Japanese Empire on and around Guadalcanal Island in 1942. The unit scale is company-level for the ground game and squadron-level for the air forces. Naval counters represent one ship for carriers and battleships, two ships for cruisers, and destroyer flotillas.<br/><br/>&quot;We struck at Guadalcanal to halt the advance of the Japanese. We did not know how strong he was, nor did we know his plans. We knew only that he was moving down the island chain and that he had to be stopped ... From that moment in 1942, the tide turned, and the Japanese never again advanced.&quot; -- Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC, Commanding General, 1st Marine Division<br/><br/>The strategic situation at the time found both sides relatively equal in strength for one of the few times in the war. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the ensuing string of rapid conquests, Japanese fortunes had taken a turn for the worse. At the Battle of Coral Sea, American carrier-based air power fought to a draw with the vaunted Japanese, serving notice that the Japanese would not be allowed to project naval power with impunity. Later, the Battle of Midway saw four Japanese carriers sunk, evening the odds in the Pacific and laying the groundwork for the first American offensive of the Pacific War.<br/><br/>The Japanese, having been blunted at Midway, turned their attention to the south, extending a siring of bases southeast through the Solomons chain. They established a seaplane base at Tulagi, and began construction of a large airfield on the island of Guadalcanal. Air pow- er based at these airfields would be able to effectively threaten American supply lines between the west coast and Australia. Shocked by the news of the Japanese airfield construction in the Solomons, the American high command gathered all available marine forces for a strike at Guadalcanal. The main force was the American First Marine Division assembled at Wellington, New Zealand. This Division, understrength and less than half trained, would bear the brunt of driving the Japanese from Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>As the morning of August 7, 1942 dawned, weeks of boredom for the Marines and occasional skirmishes for the air forces were replaced by real battle. The Marines went ashore, first at Tulagi, then Guadalcanal, and finally at Gavutu/Tanambago. The Japanese, caught unprepared by the audacious amphibious assaults, nevertheless recovered quickly and sent air, land, and naval forces to Guadalcanal. The resulting clashes shaped the future of the war in the Pacific.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring simulates this fascinating campaign &amp; includes special rules to simulate such unique aspects of the battle as: Innovative combat resolution, integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, shore bombardment, air support, and even Banzai charges into one easy-to-use system. Full-featured naval and air game that integrates with the island fighting. Engineers to rebuild airfields and construct improved positions. Japanese hidden units and limited U.S. intelligence.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring can be played by one to four players. Solitaire play is possible with a slight modification to the naval rules, while team play is easily accommodated with one player commanding the ground forces and one the air and naval forces for each side. An introductory scenario, several short scenarios, and a grand campaign game allow players to experience the battle for Guadalcanal over a variety of time spans.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3.5 days<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Operation Shoestring rulebook<br/>Six single-side printed player aid cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/>One counter storage tray<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-30 depending on scenario<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jhXzIXkCLXdfq1fTikdtQg__thumb/img/gGFMK-Jp-ilWeaO-_0PafMpUM04=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1630950.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jhXzIXkCLXdfq1fTikdtQg__original/img/yX3t-xhdKFTUiXEXQxsQywYH0k0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1630950.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1990,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Gene Billingsley","artist":"Rodger B.

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...<br/><br/>Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.<br/><br/>The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.<br/><br/>The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xUhRmZLFxRY8k6StocpI0Q__thumb/img/h477qBpPphksiky4v0-QocVGwrM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic16960.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xUhRmZLFxRY8k6StocpI0Q__original/img/JLL6y7Hxi1eaJOjru376-i4KyiQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic16960.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":7,"yearPublished":1997,"publisher":"OSG (Operational Studies Group)","designer":"Nicolas Pilartz, Kevin Zucker","artist":"Christopher Moeller","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6,7],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,null],"avgRating":6.43571,"avgWeight":3.3846},{"bggId":10822,"name":"The Seven Years World War","description":"Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #221.<br/><br/>Seven Years World War (7YWW) is a wargame simulating the global conflict of 1756-63.

An invisible murderer is walking through the Town &mdash; merciless, weightless, and listless. No one knows how to protect themselves against it or who is to become its next victim. Seems like the Town is doomed &mdash; yet, those of its inhabitants who are privy to the mystery of its internal structure are still trying to fight back. Their efforts and hopes are guided by the knowledge and the will of three outstanding persons.<br/><br/>Tabletop Pathologic is an asymmetrical stealth action game intended for 2&ndash;4 players. Three of them become doctors trying to save the Town, while the fourth takes on the role of the Sand Plague. In order to complete missions the doctors have to risk themselves and their Entwined companions, but it&rsquo;s their only chance to win. The Plague remains unseen until it decides to strike&mdash;and then it strikes mercilessly.<br/><br/>Tabletop Pathologic is designed after Pathologic the videogame and strives to keep what made its predecessor special: the atmosphere a town in agony, the feeling of doom and the desperate hope of those who have nothing else left. It&rsquo;s precisely this hope that makes the three doctors pursuing the same goal become rivals. There&rsquo;s only one winner in the game, so contesting other players is unavoidable.<br/><br/>The board game is available as a reward for backing the remake of Pathologic the video game on Kickstarter.

Simple enough for beginners, the game system also has subtle depths that will provide a satisfying challenge for the experienced player.<br/><br/>The VOID rulebook contains all the rules of play, an armory section and army lists for the four human armies: Viridians, Junkers, Syntha and VASA, as well as the mysterious alien race, the Koralon.<br/><br/>A miniature line covering all five armies supports VOID.

In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.<br/><br/>Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zyHadVhVueZI1EnkWrMtrQ__thumb/img/EYzZpEclKMadN50A5a5IgjbmQbI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic288457.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zyHadVhVueZI1EnkWrMtrQ__original/img/YtDapr7KNT3y3AwRHxG5fLCqzWw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic288457.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"Peregrine Games","designer":"Tom Reeves","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.55695,"avgWeight":4.2308},{"bggId":247394,"name":"EXO: Mankind Reborn","description":"EXO: Mankind Reborn takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has survived natural catastrophes taking refuge in underground caves (like the famous Son Doong cave) for centuries while on the surface, the only ones that have managed to survive are the insects, because of their adaptability and their affinity to a mysterious energy that arises during the natural catastrophes: the EXO-energy.<br/><br/>In EXO, you will become the incarnation the chosen heroes of the main tribes that inhabit the underground caves to unveil the secrets of the EXO-energy.<br/><br/>This is a co-operative survival board game in which players will experience the pressure of having to obtain the necessary resources to survive and fight the insects swarm all while they are fulfilling the objectives of each mission in a story that is told throughout a campaign.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is divided into two phases: Day and night.

Those dice generate the most valuable currency in the game -- Envelopes of Cash -- which are used to lure the athletes to your program.  To succeed, you need to balance the benefits of your cards, which make recruiting easier, with the nuts and bolts of actually getting out there and recruiting, by sending lots of recruiting mail, traveling to visit the athletes in their home states, and most importantly, slipping them those valuable tokens of your affection in little colored envelopes.<br/><br/>You only have 12 months to gather as many different recruits across a variety of football positions (like QB, LB, etc.), so the tension between less income now vs. more income later plays a role in shaping your strategy.

Unimaginable market potential is now within arm&rsquo;s reach, just waiting to be exploited. In the dawn of a new aggressive space race, conflict is inevitable!<br/><br/>Orbital Conflict is a card game where each player during several turns build and modify a space station and manage its resources. Each turn is divided into three phases. Draw, Main and Combat phase.<br/><br/>In the draw phase each player takes turn drawing two station cards and two investor cards. When all have done the draw phase the Main phase begins.<br/><br/>In the main phase each player takes turn playing station cards from the hand to the player's station. They can either be played as a standalone module or extend existing once into more advanced modules. Cards can have production, requirements, attack, defense and victory points. The player will try to build a station that meets the demands of the two investor cards draw in previous phase. Investor are worth different amount of victory points, some are easy to claim while others require a big station. Some cards even has special abilities that apply when part of a station. When all have done the main phase the combat phase begins. Unclaimed investor cards are discarded (new once are draw in the draw phase).<br/><br/>In the combat phase a player may choose to attack another player's station using modules with attack values or discard cards from the hand that gives additional attacks.<br/><br/>When the last card in the draw pile has been drawn a last turn is played. Afterwards each player counts victory points from claimed investors and from the station. The player with the highest amount wins the game.<br/><br/>Noteworthy mechanics are no hand limit, that station cards can extend by being placed on top or below existing once. Claimed investor cards have a mini-game like mechanic where they are pushed from the right or left.<br/><br/>Orbital conflict balance station building, light resource management with aggressive combat and point gathering. There is no player elimination and stations can be destroyed and rebuilt several times during a game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mSQnPWTI0L4SiqcNScLrTA__thumb/img/2wOZVs7E5ONoAPOscaBjETSnnvk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4731729.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mSQnPWTI0L4SiqcNScLrTA__original/img/hVeZzqeCm6W1FMB6GZhFlvccZ9M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4731729.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Steel Cave Studio AB","designer":"Kim Astor, Filip Stjernberg","artist":"Kim Astor","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":7.26923,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":321140,"name":"Ahau: Rulers of Yucatán","description":"Ahau: Rulers of Yucat&aacute;n is a Euro-style board game, combining elements of worker placement and resource management with innovative dual-engine building - all set in the Classical Period of the Maya.<br/><br/>In the game, the players take the roles of leaders of city-states who are all eager to climb the ladder of power and become the most famous ruler of this era.

(The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)<br/><br/>In the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low.

In this game for 1-5 players, you and your fellow travelers each represent a country in a maiden voyage of the first starship to ever use a newly developed warp drive. The goal is to brave the unknown and collect discoveries in four different star systems. Though you may have to cooperate, one player will bring special fame and fortune to their home country. Will it be you?<br/><br/>In Expedition Zetta, you start the game by recruiting 1-4 crew members, then you will:<br/><br/><br/>    Discover strange planetary systems, randomly generated each game based on the latest scientific data<br/>    Find exotic new substances never before seen<br/>    Develop exo-products that can advance human technology<br/>    Gain new knowledge<br/>    Encounter new forms of life or ruins and settlements of vanished, ancient alien civilizations with their promise of both danger and discovery<br/>    Perhaps encounter another star-faring civilization whose members might even become part of your crew, making it not only international but interstellar<br/>    See crew interactions that can lead to romance or intrigue, which can either help or hinder you<br/><br/><br/>Every game plays differently! Each game includes four planetary systems. After warping together to a distant star, you travel with your crew individually between planets, searching for life and substances or trying to construct exo-products. If the life you find is intelligent, you may even interact with it. The discoveries are your main source of Fame.<br/><br/>The revolutionary Zetta Planetary System Generator, used in the advanced game, can generate as many different star systems in the game as there are in the known universe, each with its own unique characteristics and its own name. Thus, no two voyages to the stars will ever be the same! During the warp stage in the advanced game, you interact with the other players' crew members to gain advantages. Romance or intrigue may occur, with varying effects.<br/><br/>Apart from the gameplay experience, a journey with Expedition Zetta will give you knowledge about stars and planets, along with memories of when you for instance managed to extract gems from a gaseous giant in a triple star system, from when you found life in a lenticular galaxy or when you managed to produce time crystals near a super-hot supergiant O-star.<br/><br/>Expedition Zetta has a basic version that is great for the whole family.<br/><br/>    Want a quick game?

It takes place between two events revealing the working conditions of textile workers:<br/><br/>- On November 25, 1910, a fire occurred at a four-story factory in Newark, New Jersey. 25 factory workers, mostly young women, died.<br/>- On March 25, 1911, exactly four months after the Newark event, a fire engulfs the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, occupied by the Triangle Waist Company, causing the death of 146 workers.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/>&quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; is a historical and cooperative survival game that simulates the struggle of the workers in New York between the years 1910 and 1911; for their survival; against employer offensives; for the control of the means of production.<br/><br/>Workers pose and resource collection mechanisms allow for a fluid game; and a system of elements with their historical context, which facilitates immersion.<br/><br/>This game will particularly appeal to players who like adversity, cooperation, immersion, History ... and perseverance!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>1-A game lasts 10 turns. Each turn, the bosses carry out offensives through cards drawn at random. These cards establish temporary or permanent mini-rules against players.<br/><br/>2-You will be playing a family or a small group of people living together. Each member is one of your &quot;workers&quot; and has one action to perform per turn.<br/><br/>3-Each turn, you send your &quot;workers&quot; to the Tiles of New York in order to: a / work and be paid in order to pay your rent, your food and the expenses of the struggle; b / work in political places to cause agitation, strikes or sabotage.<br/><br/>4-Then, you will use agitation, strikes and sabotage to fight the bosses offensives against your rights.<br/><br/>5-With the added agitation, evolve the New York Tiles to make them more worker friendly; complete 6 objectives and take control of the means of production BEFORE the bosses take control of everything and even leave you enough to survive.<br/><br/>6-Be careful, each turn you will have to draw: a / misfortune cards which will make everyone's life even more difficult; b / incident cards which will strike the player who will have the most Risk (obtained according to the work), Police Threat (obtained by causing agitation) OR the least healthy.<br/><br/>7-You could end up with workers in prison, injured, or sick. Which will lower your possibilities for your next turn.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>1-Victory: Take control of New York's means of production by purchasing 6 objectives with your resources.<br/>2-You lose if you fail to pay the cost of your living or if the bosses reach turn 10.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/95o84qgrhJsEy0hzfC6m-Q__thumb/img/9cOPFWD0hjW_K7-u64eFvxOi4Kg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6260821.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/95o84qgrhJsEy0hzfC6m-Q__original/img/AvKIthAN9hosGrnHqGzSQYj8DhA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6260821.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Yeast Games","designer":"Franck \"Counit\" Catoire, Alexandre Weiss","artist":"Jeremy Laplatine","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":9.07865,"avgWeight":3.8333},{"bggId":41065,"name":"Longships","description":"Longships is a Viking-themed plunder/trading game. Players start in the North Sea with an empty Longship each, surrounded by four countries: Denmark, Norway, Scotland and England. Players have to start with plundering at least one country each in order to get some initial resources to trade with. Trading is driven by differences in the countries' resources; each country produces 2 out of the 4 resources Cloth, Furs, Thralls and Mushrooms. Nearby countries differ on one resource only, while countries on opposite sides of the North Sea have a totally different set of resources. Long-distance trading is thus more profitable, but also more dangerous as changing weather conditions can make open sea-traveling fatal.<br/><br/>The countries themselves are weak in defense and easy to plunder. However, plundering a country weakens its trading potential, so that Vikings need to defend countries they build their trade on from Vikings plundering. Plundering a country also makes its population hostile to you, so that you can't build or repair Longships there, making you more vulnerable on expeditions to those countries. The key to success is thus to keep your hostilities at an optimal level.<br/><br/>Resources gained from trading or plundering can be sacrificed to the gods in order to gain additional actions. Sacrificing Thralls to Odin gets you new fresh men to throw into the fights, sacrificing to Thor lets you change the weather conditions, get yourself a beneficial trade wind or sink your foes with mighty storms. Mushrooms make you go berserk and fight and plunder more efficiently, while Freya helps cities grow and prosper and give more trading opportunities.<br/><br/>Resources can also be used to build new Longships, increasing the Viking's trading and military power. Just like in real life, the winner at the end of the game is the player with the most Longships.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NmC0zp1tn_7uLeDKFQugQA__thumb/img/BfnEUghvjUAChnDawoguT9cVe5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic575888.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NmC0zp1tn_7uLeDKFQugQA__original/img/c7WHoyv3JycislLKFjYmQHvb_j0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic575888.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"Mondainai","designer":"Harald Enoksson","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5,6],"avgRating":6.14348,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":128219,"name":"Shafausa","description":"While digging on the slopes of Mount Ego, the Dwarves of Shafausa discovered a secret passage under the falls of the river Rain. From there they gained access into a subterranean world of obscure galleries and gigantic caves, full of immeasurable wealth. The exploitation of this area rapidly assured the small tribe a lifestyle far superior to anything previously known in Helvetia. Their neighbours, the Vampires of Zugriga, immediately realised the fantastic commercial potential of these discoveries. Thanks to a clever stock exchange system, they implicated the other Helvetian tribes in their dealings, for the joy and well-being of all &ndash; or so they claimed.<br/><br/>But wealth doesn't just fall from the sky, and it takes a good dose of know-how to be able to rival with the skill of a vampire...<br/><br/>In Shafausa, each player represents a Helvetian tribe that has come to propose a new monetary system based on an exchange of resources. Each round players can make purchases (buildings, mines, warehouses) and exchange currency &ndash; and through these transactions influence the stock market for the prosperity of their region. Each player holds three Power cards with special actions, but can use only one during the game as the other two are then removed from play. The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round having seven phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Extraction: Mines and certain buildings produce resources, with some buildings affecting how many resources something produces.<br/>    Order of Play: Players bid for turn order; as players drop from the bidding, they place their marker in line relative to those who have previously dropped out, so whoever stays in the longest can get the position he wants.<br/>    Buying and Constructing: In turn order, players buy at most one available building and construct two warehouses; alternatively, a player can pay to remove a building in order to make space for new buildings next round.<br/>    Management: Players can build mines, add miners to their workforce, construct purchased buildings, buy and sell resources, and construct new towns.<br/>    Administration: Players pay for buildings in reserve and check their resource limits; resource costs are adjusted based on past sales.<br/>    Speculation: In turn order, players pay to adjust the prices of various resources, with each price marker being adjustable only once.<br/>    End of Game Check: If one of a player's towns or warehouses has been filled, the game ends. Players then score points for their towns, mines, buildings, and so on, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to this &quot;Geek&quot; version of the rules, Shafausa includes a &quot;Colonial&quot; version in which players draft start-up tiles (instead of starting with pre-determined characters who come with specific buildings, funds, etc.) and a &quot;Family&quot; version that removes the &quot;Speculation&quot; phase, simplifies turn order, and otherwise makes the game less involved.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dF0FcTKMkREtU_otQ7hwQg__thumb/img/vy8LccMnMQlXVVzj9-wsLUYxSPg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1374975.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dF0FcTKMkREtU_otQ7hwQg__original/img/pMj7tDbtFCCc0k4BEABIEVUEh70=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1374975.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Helvetia Games","designer":"Christophe Borgeat","artist":"Lorenzo Mastroianni","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.0079,"avgWeight":3.3077},{"bggId":201345,"name":"Kerosene","description":"From the publisher (translated):<br/>The first oil field in the world has just been discovered, the first oil companies have just been founded, one of the largest industries worldwide is about to unfold.

This 3-4 hour game thus lasts a maximum of twelve turns.<br/><br/>Players command infantry and cavalry armies, and for some factions fleets and aircraft. Leaders assist these units in movement and combat over land areas and sea zones. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for armies, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Factions thus use manpower to rebuild forces, and money to finance their actions. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor, with hits reducing them in strength or eliminating them outright. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is also rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there).<br/><br/>Finally, to keep the game from becoming too &quot;Risk&quot;-like, players can play various event cards.
