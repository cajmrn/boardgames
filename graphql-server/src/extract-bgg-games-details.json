[{"bggId":174430,"name":"Gloomhaven","description":"Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br/><br/>This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__thumb/img/veqFeP4d_3zNhFc3GNBkV95rBEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2437871.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__original/img/7d-lj5Gd1e8PFnD97LYFah2c45M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2437871.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Cephalofair Games","designer":"Isaac Childres","artist":"Alexandr Elichev, Josh T.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Roxley","designer":"Gavan Brown, Matt Tolman, Martin Wallace","artist":"Lina Cossette, David Forest, Damien Mammoliti","honors":"2018 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":8.65426,"avgWeight":3.9068},{"bggId":233078,"name":"Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition","description":"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.<br/><br/>No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.<br/><br/>A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.<br/><br/>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.<br/><br/>Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.<br/><br/>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br/>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br/>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br/>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.<br/><br/>When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__thumb/img/BTxqxgYay5tHJfVoJ2NF5g43_gA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3536616.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__original/img/thIqWDnH9utKuoKVEUqveDixprI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3536616.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"FryxGames","designer":"Jacob Fryxelius","artist":"Isaac Fryxelius","honors":"2016 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":8.39397,"avgWeight":3.2514},{"bggId":291457,"name":"Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion","description":"Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br/><br/>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br/><br/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br/><br/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br/><br/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__thumb/img/aUlIih2_R7P8IYKeyNl2heLQbu8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7013651.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__original/img/9uLd9C3XAvInLCLhAoXqKVk56zs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7013651.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Greater Than Games, LLC","designer":"R.

Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.<br/><br/>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.<br/><br/>Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).<br/><br/>Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br/><br/>Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br/><br/>Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__thumb/img/eQ69OEDdjYjfKg6q5Navee87skU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3163924.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__original/img/HlDb9F365w0tSP8uD1vf1pfniQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3163924.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Stonemaier Games","designer":"Jamey Stegmaier","artist":"Jakub Rozalski","honors":"2016 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":8.19036,"avgWeight":3.4347},{"bggId":167355,"name":"Nemesis","description":"Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror.

You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Build an industry tile<br/>    Build a rail or canal<br/>    Develop an industry<br/>    Sell cotton<br/>    Take a loan<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards.

You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.<br/><br/>When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.<br/>In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.<br/><br/>In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:<br/>A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.<br/><br/>Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.<br/><br/>You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you&rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.<br/><br/>UPC 681706716909<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__thumb/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__original/img/N1X-0JB1GapFVhl98nP4tNFXMcM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3146943.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Feuerland Spiele","designer":"Uwe Rosenberg","artist":"Dennis Lohausen","honors":"2016 Cardboard Republic Daredevil Laurel Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":8.19079,"avgWeight":3.8539},{"bggId":120677,"name":"Terra Mystica","description":"In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.<br/><br/>Terra Mystica is a full information game, without any luck, that rewards strategic planning.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.<br/><br/>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.<br/><br/>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.<br/><br/>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__thumb/img/3Ae-ieYpDv6w0vuNsGjOmXdcCrU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1790789.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__original/img/h9il8XnFB0iqHNHsNTPNGxJZWdM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1790789.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":7,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Lookout Games","designer":"Uwe Rosenberg","artist":"Javier González Cava, Klemens Franz","honors":"2013 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":7.98259,"avgWeight":3.7802},{"bggId":256960,"name":"Pax Pamir: Second Edition","description":"In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.<br/><br/>In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.<br/><br/>After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__thumb/img/NyoufH5YBFCh1rKy4uy76bR4ITk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__original/img/7DlaMCmuoJzm9AzelmStYIDgutI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4503733.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Wehrlegig Games","designer":"Cole Wehrle","artist":"Cole Wehrle","honors":"2019 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":8.29169,"avgWeight":3.8404},{"bggId":31260,"name":"Agricola","description":"Description from BoardgameNews<br/><br/>In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__thumb/img/GHGdnCfeysoP_34gLnofJcNivW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__original/img/toobKoejPiHpfpHk4SYd1UAJafw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic831744.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Lookout Games","designer":"Uwe Rosenberg","artist":"Klemens Franz","honors":"2007 Meeples' Choice Award","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,5],"avgRating":7.90504,"avgWeight":3.6373},{"bggId":185343,"name":"Anachrony","description":"It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.<br/><br/>By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...<br/><br/>Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.<br/><br/>The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__thumb/img/a0G93aMOKp3_mmnCURYWuZd210U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499707.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__original/img/3KfMPSj7jjhG0g5lQBsO-bn67D0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499707.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Mindclash Games","designer":"Dávid Turczi, Richard Amann, Viktor Peter","artist":"Villő Farkas, László Fejes, Laslo Forgach, Márton Gyula Kiss, Péter Meszlényi","honors":"2017 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":8.10643,"avgWeight":4.0129},{"bggId":221107,"name":"Pandemic Legacy: Season 2","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The world almost ended 71 years ago...<br/><br/>The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world.

As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company&rsquo;s private agenda.<br/><br/>In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food &mdash; the necessities for survival.<br/><br/>Do you dare take part in humankind&rsquo;s biggest challenge?<br/><br/>On Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase ​and the Shuttle Phase​.<br/><br/>During the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet&rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.<br/><br/>All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony&rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.<br/><br/>During the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__thumb/img/4GFbhkEWyIublXmikE2Tep6wSIQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4357658.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__original/img/GNjjsgxq7wYO9pSIteDJe6Sxt00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4357658.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Eagle-Gryphon Games","designer":"Vital Lacerda","artist":"Ian O'Toole","honors":"2019 Cardboard Republic Architect Laurel Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":8.22701,"avgWeight":4.6662},{"bggId":126163,"name":"Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar","description":"Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement.

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.<br/><br/>In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.<br/><br/>As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.<br/><br/>With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault – Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__thumb/img/AD5YvNSUaVvITmtQb1-b01VuBbs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247647.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__original/img/12Xvbw01hpsAjsO0xrajZt2b5HY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2247647.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Justin Kemppainen, Corey Konieczka, Jonathan Ying","artist":"Arden Beckwith, Christopher Burdett, Rovina Cai, Lucas Durham, Joel Hustak, Michal Ivan, David Kegg, Henning Ludvigsen, Brynn Metheney, Vlad Ricean, Ryan Valle, Ben Zweifel","honors":"2014 Board Game Quest Awards Best Production Values Nominee","bestPlayers":[2,5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.98295,"avgWeight":3.3049},{"bggId":55690,"name":"Kingdom Death: Monster","description":"Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.

In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture.

Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. <br/>All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. <br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.<br/>The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.<br/>Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.<br/>Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. <br/>When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oeygRZntjNUJWvc8SxDfww__thumb/img/PUmSkY6ZKL81b6YuP1U59R3VdRE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic784193.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oeygRZntjNUJWvc8SxDfww__original/img/U-WjAGlPXS_p89z4R0V4b8IADxA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic784193.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Chad Jensen","artist":"Bartek Jędrzejewski, Chad Jensen, Rodger B.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__thumb/img/3mn0EVxxfT94rit8VHiyEYztGeg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5373572.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__original/img/TCTXvYRQGWMAngXuHZcIXRknfpc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5373572.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1995,"publisher":"Hans im Glück","designer":"Wolfgang Kramer, Richard Ulrich","artist":"Doris Matthäus","honors":"1995 Meeples' Choice Award","bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.74082,"avgWeight":3.0426},{"bggId":122515,"name":"Keyflower","description":"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds.

Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.<br/><br/>In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game.

Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.<br/><br/>The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village.

Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.<br/><br/>As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game.

Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.<br/><br/>After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth.

Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game.

They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town.

To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.<br/><br/>Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.<br/><br/>The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game.

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?<br/><br/>Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br/><br/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.<br/><br/>All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br/><br/>With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__thumb/img/I1oCwOcGxAOVx2VE2LcXuKWoLvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1872452.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__original/img/vxK08kQAEn5qPbejK2CUTyWOsig=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1872452.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Corey Konieczka, Nikki Valens","artist":"Anders Finér, David Griffith, Ed Mattinian, Patrick McEvoy, Dallas Mehlhoff, Emilio Rodriguez, Magali Villeneuve, Drew Whitmore","honors":"2013 Board Game Quest Awards Best Coop Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":7.76595,"avgWeight":3.3226},{"bggId":12493,"name":"Twilight Imperium: Third Edition","description":"Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well.

At the beginning of each round, you roll three dice to determine their value. You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...<br/><br/>You can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church.

In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.<br/><br/>The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:<br/>- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.<br/>- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.<br/>- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.<br/><br/>The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:<br/>- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces<br/>- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.<br/>- earn 2 coins<br/>- take 2 temporary workers<br/>- jump ahead in turn order<br/>- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you<br/><br/>Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__thumb/img/oZkHYUMtcGVwg_gz6OjtuiD3vmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1772936.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__original/img/EnBmUkDKSbcBusI6nVRczadYs0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1772936.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Hans im Glück","designer":"Helmut Ohley, Leonhard \"Lonny\" Orgler","artist":"Martin Hoffmann, Claus Stephan","honors":"2013 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.74883,"avgWeight":3.4083},{"bggId":205896,"name":"Rising Sun","description":"The great and forgotten Kami have returned from the underworld, displeased with the affairs of the Empire&rsquo;s present Shōgun. At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Shōgun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?<br/><br/>Rising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.<br/>Over the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.<br/><br/>In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.<br/>Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.<br/><br/>The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. <br/>Each Season is divided into five phases: <br/>1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, <br/>2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, <br/>3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,<br/>4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and <br/>5) Seasonal Cleanup.<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__thumb/img/UNKv6MWzJUAwhhP7-ng6HoinRa8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3880340.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__original/img/pKJ1XyLN4hvHim5eRj2VJHijv1E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3880340.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"CMON Global Limited","designer":"Eric M.

Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player's wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose a building tile representing a room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited. Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed.

On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these actions?

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.<br/><br/>Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes &mdash; or they will do the same to you.<br/><br/>Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:<br/><br/><br/>     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources<br/>     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities<br/>     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units<br/>     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.<br/><br/><br/>The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.<br/><br/>Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__thumb/img/cudczHrJs0wFKywIHBQ6Fb7D7oY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2471359.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__original/img/AQ1P6PKw7ZW-XTOAFKhCwsnfP0I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2471359.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Samuel Bailey, James Kniffen, Corey Konieczka","artist":"","honors":"2015 Board Game Quest Awards Best Tactical/Combat Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[2,3],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":7.97048,"avgWeight":3.8318},{"bggId":4098,"name":"Age of Steam","description":"Steam-belching iron horses roar across the wild plains!

Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.<br/>Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.<br/><br/>During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Flavor text:<br/>Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.<br/><br/>But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__thumb/img/-a0oJ_E49V_7PDW78W7KIyS3rF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2241156.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__original/img/SP4ItZ27dLweUPbz_bF7C-P7GtA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2241156.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Czech Games Edition","designer":"Matúš Kotry","artist":"David Cochard","honors":"2014 Board Game Quest Awards Most Innovative Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.65803,"avgWeight":3.9175},{"bggId":308765,"name":"Praga Caput Regni","description":"Charles IV has been crowned King of Bohemia and ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.

Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.<br/><br/>The aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours.

The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.<br/><br/>The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.<br/><br/>The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.<br/><br/>Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.<br/><br/>The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.<br/><br/>Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__thumb/img/UHuDcnjAwCiXbNfjuY26-EEnG2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5841874.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__original/img/ehoqoTirtFb5p9Wk2SwWV8nr6ZU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5841874.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Funtails","designer":"Matthias Cramer","artist":"Jason Coates, Hendrik Noack","honors":"2019 Golden Geek Best Strategy Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[2,4],"avgRating":7.9539,"avgWeight":3.0295},{"bggId":43111,"name":"Chaos in the Old World","description":"Chaos in the Old World makes you a god.

Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.<br/><br/>Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.<br/><br/>Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location.

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__thumb/img/foFGN8KwmN8BaYNpolq0HcMba4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3016500.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__original/img/NjrnSg1aeia8I4eETDU3I1Br7a8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3016500.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Plaid Hat Games","designer":"Jonathan Gilmour, Isaac Vega","artist":"David Richards, Fernanda Suárez, Peter Wocken","honors":"2014 Board Game Quest Awards Best Coop Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.50617,"avgWeight":3.012},{"bggId":103343,"name":"A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)","description":"Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.<br/><br/>In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.<br/><br/>Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.<br/><br/>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.<br/><br/>In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.<br/><br/>Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Dance with Dragons (2012)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Feast for Crows (2013)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – Mother of Dragons (2018)<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones (2003)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__thumb/img/ZQ9guRvmMgYfseBC3_xNscMOKKo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1077906.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__original/img/3tv6H7jX5T9rqwuI84YZKZDBGcw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1077906.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2011,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Christian T.

The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.

The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production.

Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.<br/><br/>Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding.

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.<br/><br/>After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.<br/><br/>The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.<br/><br/>The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9sbSKcc-Fm8Od5wwuf3kgg__thumb/img/pb63LQr94bzh4Z6ofLNJoijRlxU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1215969.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9sbSKcc-Fm8Od5wwuf3kgg__original/img/kNoFZrbwsvMvs_iKWeKBHYLka5Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1215969.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2004,"publisher":"Hans im Glück","designer":"Rüdiger Dorn","artist":"Oliver Freudenreich","honors":"2004 Deutscher Spiele Preis Best Family/Adult Game 3rd Place","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.56885,"avgWeight":3.3734},{"bggId":285967,"name":"Ankh: Gods of Egypt","description":"Play as a god of ancient Egypt, competing to survive as society begins to forget the old ways, so that only you and your followers remain.<br/><br/>Build caravans, summon monsters, and convert followers in your quest to reign supreme in Ankh: Gods of Egypt.

One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.<br/><br/>This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.<br/><br/>The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer).

And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan&rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash &mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait &mdash; what&rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook &hellip; considerably, in fact &hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip;<br/><br/>Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.<br/><br/>Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__thumb/img/RCh0FVF5BT9-ATms0Wc_6hs2z5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic93485.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__original/img/ujxqaJuxawHp28WMvjv4JyUp0ac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic93485.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2005,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Jeroen Kesselaar, Ynze Moedt","honors":"2006 International Gamers Awards - General Strategy; Multi-player Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.87758,"avgWeight":3.9837},{"bggId":59294,"name":"Runewars","description":"Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players.

The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.

Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?<br/><br/>In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 &quot;glory&quot; points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.<br/><br/>A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__thumb/img/Rd6POAEmJOEtwKB7bSDTKPsL_9k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic738119.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__original/img/wrLHO6mElyCGzog0aHzJ9KE-SeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic738119.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Z-Man Games","designer":"Kasper Aagaard, Christian Marcussen","artist":"Ben Nelson, Chris Quilliams","honors":"2011 Golden Geek Best Board Game Artwork/Presentation Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.39405,"avgWeight":3.2449},{"bggId":297030,"name":"Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun","description":"Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as &quot;The Most Select of Places&quot; (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.<br/><br/>Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.<br/><br/>The game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.<br/><br/>The game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.<br/><br/>As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.<br/><br/>When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!<br/><br/>Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__thumb/img/QaUXxrgmXFrlNADgPeGhY5F538g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5313583.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__original/img/jEL4WHl98vZHaZFcw9hDXxsxjSo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5313583.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Board&Dice","designer":"Daniele Tascini, Dávid Turczi","artist":"Michał Długaj, Jakub Fajtanowski, Zbigniew Umgelter, Aleksander Zawada","honors":"2020 Cardboard Republic Tactician Laurel Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":7.77879,"avgWeight":4.084},{"bggId":304420,"name":"Bonfire","description":"The bonfires are sources of light, energy and warmth created by the guardians of light in order to brighten the cities on the otherwise dark planet.

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.<br/><br/>In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.<br/><br/>Here's the flavour text from the rules:<br/><br/>The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...<br/><br/><br/>The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.<br/><br/>Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.<br/><br/>Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__thumb/img/tGLIa6i13UQJv2-Xj47XEHZrDRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1400856.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__original/img/gtQ1AZ8xqbjEq9KhLK6aoz9TQm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1400856.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Ynze Moedt","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.82187,"avgWeight":3.6738},{"bggId":291572,"name":"Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile","description":"In Oath, one to six players guide the course of history in an ancient land.

China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.<br/><br/>The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.<br/><br/>G&ugrave;gōng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor.

In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.<br/><br/>As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.<br/><br/>The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx.

The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.<br/><br/>As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.<br/><br/>In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game.

Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.<br/><br/>Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is almost all simultaneous play.<br/><br/>Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__thumb/img/ptUAPVk_LoqX7qDUt7ngtDXe-Qw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4981297.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__original/img/1D98HsjtX5IzcwUMvd-67z1xzKo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4981297.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":9,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"WizKids (I)","designer":"TauCeti Deichmann","artist":"Kwanchai Moriya, Jesse Seidule, Nakarin Sukontakorn","honors":"2017 Cardboard Republic Daredevil Laurel Nominee","bestPlayers":[6,7],"goodPlayers":[4,5,8,9],"avgRating":7.79266,"avgWeight":3.5448},{"bggId":96913,"name":"Lancaster","description":"From the designer of Glen More comes a new title published by Queen Games: Lancaster.<br/><br/>In 1413, the new king of England, Henry V of Lancaster, has ambitious plans: The unification of England and the conquest of the French crown!

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.<br/><br/>Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.<br/><br/>Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.<br/>Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.<br/><br/>The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown.

Play proceeds in a series of stock rounds, each followed by a pair of operating rounds.  In stock rounds, players act as investors buying and selling stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, corporations will lay track, build stations, run trains for revenue to be paid out as dividends or withheld, and buy trains.  The majority shareholder of each corporation acts at its president, making all decisions during operating rounds.  Players will continue operating companies, collecting dividends, and reinvesting until the bank breaks.<br/><br/>1846 features several unique elements, such as scaling the number of corporations, private companies, and bank size to the number of players.

Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.<br/><br/>The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.<br/><br/>The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.<br/><br/>There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.<br/><br/>In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.<br/><br/>Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.<br/><br/>Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.<br/><br/>Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.<br/><br/>In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.<br/><br/>Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.<br/>For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-uqqRB-Ybm6oD5jWv9cSw__thumb/img/mJ6WPCY8ub5LWFnpCnusv42WNhI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic713985.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-uqqRB-Ybm6oD5jWv9cSw__original/img/pOBZTUAqNmdJzkhEuFkxxnaGedk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic713985.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1999,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Herman Haverkort, Tamara Jannink","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[1,3,4],"avgRating":7.71768,"avgWeight":4.1911},{"bggId":42052,"name":"Vinhos","description":"Vinhos (Portuguese word for &quot;wines&quot;) is a trading and economic game about wine making.<br/><br/>Despite its small size, Portugal is one of the world&rsquo;s leading wine producers.

An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.<br/><br/>Description<br/><br/>In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).<br/><br/>Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.<br/><br/>Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.<br/><br/>Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.<br/><br/>&quot;Reimplements&quot;<br/><br/>     StarCraft (video game)<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tXwlK5uyyxaMzXG65NZ3Xg__thumb/img/-93qv9jIN6Lx9DZUCg9W8i-t6P8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic265704.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tXwlK5uyyxaMzXG65NZ3Xg__original/img/J5-KA7kHSx-6ln75ntNNy9OeBwA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic265704.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Corey Konieczka, Christian T.

Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.<br/><br/>From the designer:<br/>Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution.

In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.<br/><br/>Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!<br/><br/>In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.<br/><br/>The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.<br/><br/>The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2gP4Uti9RPquZVlweeapLw__thumb/img/fe1ELDopk_qSeiDruI0hs8nmzSQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2783386.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2gP4Uti9RPquZVlweeapLw__original/img/BBz4zQ1fTrQtAs_lr39MF6ia-Og=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2783386.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Nate French, Eric M.

A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold.

Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents.

But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;<br/><br/>&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?<br/>&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?<br/>&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?<br/>&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?<br/>&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?<br/>&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?<br/>&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?<br/>&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?<br/>&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?<br/>&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?<br/>&hellip; and much more.<br/><br/>New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:<br/><br/>&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.<br/>&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  <br/>&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  <br/>&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.<br/>&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.<br/>&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.<br/>&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.<br/><br/>More COIN Series Volumes to Come<br/><br/>Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series.  Volume III is A Distant Plain—Insurgency in Afghanistan.  Volume IV is Fire in the Lake—Insurgency in Vietnam.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6z5ZMIVpFUzn1DHhto3RLw__thumb/img/Zsirgs7exejEoHOaAYhUZMALGUU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1723711.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6z5ZMIVpFUzn1DHhto3RLw__original/img/Pj0LixQN2LDDFZ2OQGa_XfwDPWc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1723711.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Jeff Grossman, Volko Ruhnke","artist":"Xavier Carrascosa, Rodger B.

This deck functions like one in a deck-building game, but the cards in the deck are sleeved, and rather than add new crew cards to your deck, you improve the skill and abilities of your crew cards by placing transparent &quot;advancement&quot; cards in those sleeves. Aside from the transparent advancements, your crew will also &quot;level up&quot; naturally during the game using a new card-leveling mechanism not seen in other card-crafting games such as Mystic Vale.<br/><br/>&bull; Control the region: The region is filled with many deserted islands.

The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points.

After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what's going on inside his colony &ndash; that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).<br/><br/>The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.<br/><br/>After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't.

Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.<br/><br/>Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.<br/><br/>Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.<br/><br/>In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.<br/><br/>Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/asueS9har0y10uk672cbGw__thumb/img/80v16ohwO4WQNiR6Yoo_9IHI2NY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2242246.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/asueS9har0y10uk672cbGw__original/img/nq95-sVAgp9Hc4nNi8UMrJt2LFw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2242246.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"What's Your Game?","designer":"Marco Canetta, Stefania Niccolini","artist":"Mariano Iannelli","honors":"2014 Meeples' Choice Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.57083,"avgWeight":3.8319},{"bggId":173064,"name":"Leaving Earth","description":"The year is 1956.

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.<br/><br/>Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.<br/><br/>Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.<br/><br/>Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__thumb/img/4M7epe99tiI_bvQGRPMo7OvxSko=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4908538.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__original/img/xzDBpZR94KRpjiKJRW5ZqYWKmMo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4908538.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1999,"publisher":"Splotter Spellen","designer":"Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga","artist":"Herman Haverkort, Tamara Jannink, Daan van Paridon, Thijs van Paridon, Joris Wiersinga","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.58289,"avgWeight":3.0438},{"bggId":154825,"name":"Arkwright","description":"In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.<br/><br/>To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.<br/><br/>You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.<br/><br/>Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).<br/><br/>After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.<br/><br/>Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.<br/><br/>After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.<br/><br/>Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.<br/><br/>To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__thumb/img/zM8pwB0LilhgIQd67L7mOgeZ25o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2776693.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__original/img/mT2Oug5XPaSWIW0M-nNoZW4qmSY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2776693.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Capstone Games","designer":"Stefan Risthaus","artist":"Harald Lieske","honors":"2014 The Golden Elephant Award Best Heavy Board Game Winner","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.81785,"avgWeight":4.5968},{"bggId":306040,"name":"Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road","description":"Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road is a tense economic game charting the rise and fall of the greatest city in the world.<br/><br/>In Merv, players are vying to amass power and wealth in the prosperous heart of the Silk Road.

Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1933.<br/><br/>Many of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift &amp; Co, Armour &amp; Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.<br/><br/>In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.<br/><br/>Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JImiygpumS35fVxlfsRPXw__thumb/img/4JoMwGJySRhnioxER3OEj6r0uYg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4223934.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JImiygpumS35fVxlfsRPXw__original/img/7uft3DL-UNgIE2MQ_B_RbdsBQKw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4223934.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Parallel Games","designer":"Raymond Chandler III","artist":"Emily R.

Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.<br/><br/>If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.<br/><br/>In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others.<br/><br/>In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of carbon emissions permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.<br/><br/>Money, CEPs, green power plants that you've built, UN goals you've completed, company goals you've met, and expertise you've gained all give you victory points (VPs), which represent your company's reputation &mdash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game &hellip; in addition to saving the planet, of course.<br/><br/>This new totally re-designed edition of CO₂ features a completely new iconography, an entirely new rulebook with lots of 3D pictures for easy comprehension of the rules, more balanced gameplay, a new events deck, improved and streamlined mechanisms, and upgraded wooden components for the power plants instead of the cardboard tokens in a game with a shorter play length.

Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.<br/><br/>In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.<br/><br/>In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.<br/><br/>Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.<br/><br/>On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing&mdash;receiving a dividend each round.

Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).<br/><br/>Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.<br/>The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.<br/><br/>Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.<br/><br/>The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.<br/><br/>Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UqnetX2v84p9ZMpzB8GiDw__thumb/img/2MTCJvG13SbBcF92yo-4wuGuY10=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1081488.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UqnetX2v84p9ZMpzB8GiDw__original/img/k-fnWjc0-WfowMr8nNeGZfbWCcQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1081488.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2011,"publisher":"WizKids (I)","designer":"Mike Elliott, Bryan Kinsella, Ethan Pasternack","artist":"","honors":"2012 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":7.48796,"avgWeight":3.056},{"bggId":256570,"name":"Crown of Emara","description":"Good times in the tiny kingdom of Emara: During the reign of King Thedorius the Wise, wars, uprisings, and other inconveniences became a thing of the past.

A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money.

Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top.

In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Buy new cards from the common display<br/>    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)<br/>    Train/Educate your people<br/>    Build/found cities<br/>    Take money<br/><br/><br/>To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.<br/><br/>It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.<br/><br/>Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols.

It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.<br/><br/>From Back of Box<br/>On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.<br/><br/>In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.<br/><br/>The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.<br/><br/>To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.<br/><br/>In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTO-71GWQCPtfms6thu_yg__thumb/img/-hEQuP_HebKIh4XlZppUkzMSOtk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic291050.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTO-71GWQCPtfms6thu_yg__original/img/ggBLDujij6IRGZg0PoMRgBdoC4g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic291050.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Histogame","designer":"Bowen Simmons","artist":"Jean-Louis Ernest Meissonier","honors":"2007 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee","bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.98835,"avgWeight":3.6504},{"bggId":12891,"name":"Friedrich","description":"Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies!

Is it Prussia's defeat or is it Prussia's glory?<br/><br/>All against one &ndash; but only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives.

Accurately based on history while maintaining a slim set of rules, Friedrich offers wide open spaces for chess-like moves and great depth for decision making.

The game is centered around the player-controlled Spirits, and the Emotion cards controlling Cerebria&rsquo;s areas, each with their own stats and abilities.<br/><br/>The Spirits can perform up to three actions on their turn. These include moving between Cerebria&rsquo;s Realms and Frontiers, using the specific powers of the Realms, invoking and upgrading Emotion cards, removing opposing Emotions, and building Fortresses to consolidate their influence on certain areas. The Actions cost Willpower, gained primarily by absorbing from the Origin&rsquo;s Spheres in the middle of the board. Both Bliss and Gloom also have a rare shared team resource, Ambition, enabling them to use the game&rsquo;s most powerful effects.<br/> The teams can score points either by accomplishing publicly known minor objectives (the Intentions), or completing their major objectives (the Aspirations), which change dynamically during the course of the game. Scoring Aspirations allows players to add Bliss and Gloom Fragments to the Identity, built in the middle of the board.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.<br/><br/>Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.<br/><br/>The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!<br/><br/>Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player.

After having acted in the dark for a long time, the time has finally come for them to take control of the cities and shape Italy&rsquo;s future. Their stories will go down in history.<br/><br/>In Signorie, you will play the role of a Signore, a Lord of one of the most prestigious families of the Renaissance.

You place it on your player board (your city) and perform one of the possible actions.

At the end of the round, if the sum of a player's chosen dice is equal or lower than 13, he can obtain a reward.<br/><br/>The dice mechanism is easy and innovative and gives players a simple, but challenging choice.

Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.<br/><br/>The six powers in Virgin Queen are:<br/><br/>     Ottoman<br/>     Spain<br/>     England<br/>     France<br/>     Holy Roman Empire<br/>     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:<br/><br/><br/>     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.<br/>     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.<br/>     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.<br/>     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?<br/>     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?<br/>     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. <br/><br/><br/>There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:<br/><br/>     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.<br/>     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.<br/>     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play. Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-YgoNoqHXqA4N_4qaxUUeQ__thumb/img/5LjNGVusukBqx7gXFljokCe3tmI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1276971.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-YgoNoqHXqA4N_4qaxUUeQ__original/img/1PSNe-YTGUbXvPO5I0BZ41laFXA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1276971.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Ed Beach","artist":"Charles Kibler, Rodger B.

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.<br/><br/>The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.<br/><br/>The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T6X1-I6St8OW50bhewvL3A__thumb/img/zqCqSXlCc4ZFzEHwMY5rYzI2dnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1273353.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T6X1-I6St8OW50bhewvL3A__original/img/PeWeYPgj5qqjbf1ToP_YXAFXT5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1273353.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1925,"publisher":"(Public Domain)","designer":"Harold Vanderbilt","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":7.44907,"avgWeight":3.8725},{"bggId":9440,"name":"Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India","description":"A board game for two to five players with elements of area control and simultaneous action selection.

Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).<br/><br/>The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.<br/><br/>Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.<br/><br/>The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.<br/><br/>The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.<br/><br/>There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.<br/><br/>The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!<br/><br/>Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls.

With massive warming altering the globe, another titanic struggle for supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.<br/><br/>Dominant Species: Marine is a game that abstractly recreates a small portion of ancient history: the ending of an onerous ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.<br/><br/>Each player will assume the role of one of four major aquatic-based animal classes &mdash; reptiles, fish, cephalopod or crustacean. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Through wily action pawn placement, you will attempt to thrive in as many different habitats as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. You will also want to propagate your individual species in order to earn victory points for your animal. You will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others.<br/><br/>All of this eventually leads to the end game &ndash; the final ascent of a vast tropical ocean and its shorelines &ndash; where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have their animal crowned the Dominant Species.<br/><br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly, because there&rsquo;s a large asteroid heading this way....<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of the main ocean on earth as it might have appeared tens of millions of years ago. The smaller Hydrothermal Vent tiles will be placed atop some of the larger tiles throughout play, converting them into Vents in the process.<br/><br/>The action pawns drive the game. Each pawn allows a player to perform the various actions that can be taken&mdash;such as speciation, environmental change, migration or evolution. When placed on the action display, a pawn will immediately trigger that particular action for its owning player. Dominant Species: Marine includes new &ldquo;special&rdquo; pawns that can be acquired during the course of play. These special pawns have enhanced placement capabilities over the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; pawns that each player begins the game with.<br/><br/>Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities, ongoing benefits, or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.<br/><br/>Throughout the game species cubes will be added to, moved about on, and removed from the tiles in play (&ldquo;earth&rdquo;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.<br/><br/>Dominant Species Veterans<br/><br/>For players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): <br/><br/>     Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board. This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn&rsquo;t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance. <br/>     Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer &lsquo;competitive&rsquo; with other players. In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it. Domination of an element is how you acquire &ndash; and try to maintain &ndash; control of the special pawns.<br/>     Animals no longer have default special abilities. Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box. The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards. <br/>     Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy. Special pawns can &lsquo;bump&rsquo; an opponent&rsquo;s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked. They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only). There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed. And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__thumb/img/JNsz6atITE84iWPiiq7ki1LaSGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5998666.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__original/img/tDNHjJ6160FjCjpY8oJuaNPQ7_k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5998666.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Chad Jensen","artist":"Chad Jensen, Chechu Nieto","honors":"2021 Cardboard Republic Striker Award Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":8.07634,"avgWeight":3.8684},{"bggId":272739,"name":"Clinic: Deluxe Edition","description":"Your Town Center is flourishing, but as the city grows, the need for emergency medical care grows with it.

Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.<br/><br/>In Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>Even without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.<br/><br/>While you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.<br/><br/>On top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.<br/><br/>While lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2uRvcCayqNG38NJQBcESAA__thumb/img/fMI59KCpNrF_uemwoD5-CBY96hc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4007841.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2uRvcCayqNG38NJQBcESAA__original/img/oqKvrfwO_KxjHMaz9kNlJf_4MlM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4007841.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Feuerland Spiele","designer":"Claudia Partenheimer, Ralf Partenheimer","artist":"Andrea Boekhoff","honors":"2018 Board Game Quest Awards Best Strategy/Euro Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[2,4],"avgRating":7.40479,"avgWeight":3.0909},{"bggId":239472,"name":"Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein","description":"It's been twenty years since Victor Frankenstein died on a ship in the arctic, but his vengeful creature lives on, as does Robert Walton, the sea captain who vowed to kill the fiend before mercy stayed his hand.

A mysterious benefactor of gigantic stature has emerged in the scientific community, never showing his face, claiming to possess the late Frankenstein's research. He sponsors a grand competition, offering an even grander prize: unlocking the mystery of mortality!<br/><br/>Renowned scientists from around the world come to take part: some drawn to solve this eternal riddle, others coerced against their will. But a certain captain comes as well, one deeply suspicious of the secretive patron, hoping to finally fulfill his vow.<br/><br/>Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein is a competitive game of strategic monster building for 2-4 players, inspired by Mary Shelley's classic novel of gothic horror. In the game, the creature demands your help to accomplish what his own creator would not: to bring to life an abomination like itself, a companion to end its miserable solitude. Through worker placement and careful management of decomposing resources, you'll gather materials from the cemeteries and morgues around the city, conduct valuable research at the Academy of Science, hire less-than-reputable associates, and toil away in your lab &mdash; all in an effort to assemble a new form of life and infuse it with a &quot;spark of being&quot;.

Beginning with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus, a period of 50 years saw nearly as many different men seize imperial power over all or part of the Empire, until the reforms of Diocletian in 284 AD ushered in an era of peace.<br/><br/>In Time of Crisis, 2-4 players take the reins of Roman dynasties, gathering and wielding influence among the senate, military, and people of Rome to ensure that their legacies are remembered by history instead of being lost to the mists of time.  Starting from control of one province and a few low-value cards, you are challenged to establish your base of power during this fragile period of Roman history.  You must build your armies, take control of valuable provinces, develop your support, and defend yourself against barbarian incursions, inopportune events, and the machinations of your political opponents.<br/><br/>Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.  It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience.  The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board.  This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.  Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns.  Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?  Or will you master a blend of all three?  In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!  However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical.<br/><br/>All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire.  Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzbAevS1luPIpQZgdqRJrA__thumb/img/jvuKcxYKE49i-mqwPfI3BqFr-Dg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3372197.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzbAevS1luPIpQZgdqRJrA__original/img/niUQQ0MZL8rl1Sgi0T3jgrHUPYg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3372197.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Ergo Ludo Editions","designer":"Wray Ferrell, Brad Johnson (I)","artist":"Rodger B.

However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.<br/><br/>Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.<br/><br/>The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W_t-KinDa1Ag3JsZrMWMVw__thumb/img/rzgzAAHJZFQ7rSIHxWwiKUJu9hY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1638689.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W_t-KinDa1Ag3JsZrMWMVw__original/img/uxlCFZBzr0LAge9KmQ-I6DKVVDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1638689.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Treefrog Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Geof Banyard, Peter Dennis, Anne Stokes","honors":"2013 Golden Geek Best Thematic Board Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.19566,"avgWeight":3.4515},{"bggId":238799,"name":"Messina 1347","description":"Messina 1347 takes place during the introduction of the plague epidemic (a.k.a. the &quot;black death&quot;) and the spreading of its infection through town.

Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.<br/><br/>In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.<br/><br/>While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.<br/><br/>Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.<br/><br/>All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HFhHL5g_mSWx-wOj9DaG7g__thumb/img/ozRX0wtjJ9ghZgTc6K2Mn-ltj2o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1246187.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HFhHL5g_mSWx-wOj9DaG7g__original/img/5EcNv8iZdIJBBTmh0GrTdIr1d6s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1246187.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Bill Eberle, John Goodenough, Jack Kittredge, Corey Konieczka, Peter Olotka, Christian T.

Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience?

If the hero gets damaged, energy moves to a wound area, and if they lose all of their energy, then they're out of action for a while to recover their strength. Each hero has differing strengths for their abilities, and these strengths are represented by colored dice with different values; the more energy a hero spends on an ability, the more dice of that color they can roll.<br/><br/>The villain controls a team of henchmen and iconic villains of the Batman universe, and these characters are represented by tiles on their command board, with the characters costing 1, 2, 3, etc. energy to activate as you move left to right down the line. Once a character is activated, they move to the end of the line, boosting their cost to the maximum value should you want to use them again immediately, and decreasing the cost of the other tiles.<br/><br/>The game-play in Batman: Gotham City Chronicles is based on that of Conan, with revisions to character abilities, the addition of two different types of dice (w/ five types total), and a modified two-player set-up, the Versus Mode, in which each player has a command board and their own team of tiles that they can draft, with heroes facing off against villains.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YGNk9UF-QqLWT58aWiRV7w__thumb/img/OJRkVH8OmPyCtrpExfCW63phnkE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3893551.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YGNk9UF-QqLWT58aWiRV7w__original/img/KdB7vv0-cUujU4-eE3udGR1xYKA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3893551.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Monolith","designer":"Frédéric Henry","artist":"Georges Clarenko, David Demaret, David Finch, Jim Lee","honors":"2019 Board Game Quest Awards Best Tactical/Combat Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.65752,"avgWeight":3.7368},{"bggId":290484,"name":"Unsettled","description":"Lost amidst the surreal and bizarre unknowns of the far reaches of the cosmos, your crew of explorers must pull together to discover the resources necessary to survive the long journey home.<br/><br/>Unsettled is a 2-4 player cooperative survival adventure set in the wondrous and unnerving fringes of uncharted space.

A new concept of maps was also introduced in this game. All maps are different and created with modular boards that recreate real regions of Brazil and the world.

A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.<br/><br/>Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.<br/><br/>A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame<br/> From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.<br/><br/>Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire<br/><br/>Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.

In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.<br/> On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor. Life is hard, but you may encounter ten men to help you; on each turn you choose one of them to increase your benefits from an action.

Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.<br/><br/>A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.<br/><br/>No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U_bfH-9EjxL3o0qoabv4Dg__thumb/img/XPpliIfx2znWrv4v2xlwb75ciYM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3024485.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U_bfH-9EjxL3o0qoabv4Dg__original/img/01D9ewNaoCbSXbAlCUmjNMy_0e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3024485.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2003,"publisher":"Mercury Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Michael Christopher, Peter Dennis, Richard Hanuschek","honors":"2004 International Gamers Awards - General Strategy; Multi-player Nominee","bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[4,6],"avgRating":7.32979,"avgWeight":3.5104},{"bggId":137649,"name":"Level 7 [Omega Protocol]","description":"Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>LEVEL 7 [Omega Protocol] picks up right where LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE] left off.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fief and Bishopric territories. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery and deception!<br/><br/>Fief is a classic French-language game and is being re-introduced by Academy Games in English with updated rules, new units, a new and larger consolidated map, and more. This edition also includes additional components, which enhances game play.<br/> The game board represents a portion of the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds and Bishoprics have heavy bordered outlines that include several different Fiefs. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.<br/><br/>In Fief: France 1429, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, he gains 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!<br/> You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to obtain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies of some other foul means!<br/><br/>In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you may draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot; and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly effect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprisings&quot;!<br/><br/>Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.<br/><br/>Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men at Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Siege Engines. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit.

During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, this swampland was slowly changed into farmland under the aegis of pharaohs such as Amenemhet III and Sesostris II. They ordered their advisors to build a system of canals and dikes to reclaim the land surrounded by desert and inhabited by crocodiles to turn it into a granary for Egypt.<br/><br/>Now, during the reign of Amenemhet III, you are the pharaoh's advisors, commanded to harvest goods, build roads, found settlements, and do much more for the good of Faiyum! You are being supplied with the necessary manpower, resources, and money, which means that if another advisor needs to use &quot;your&quot; roads, farms, and other buildings, they may do so since everything you build is owned by the pharaoh. The only thing you will own is the only thing that matters: the respect of the pharaoh.<br/><br/>Faiyum is a strategic game for enthusiasts of planning games. The basic rules are simple: Play your cards one by one on your personal discard stack. After playing some or all of your cards, you take them back into your hand in &quot;reverse&quot; playing order, so playing cards in the best order is important. Newly purchased cards go directly into your hand, so the timing of getting and playing them is important, too. Each of the individual cards has easy-to-understand actions, but only by creating the best combined &quot;engine&quot; will you be a master advisor of Faiyum.<br/><br/>This game features a card mechanism reminiscent of deck builders and the market mechanism successfully used in Power Grid. Gain more and more valuable cards, and use the structures built on the game board to your advantage &mdash; in other words, for your reputation. In the end, the most cunning advisor who creates the best card combinations will win Faiyum.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sl0ReaWGqY1LQjNoGtCPWg__thumb/img/wH5S7oMLlZsHZ-K2RLcsXIXRyi0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5638086.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sl0ReaWGqY1LQjNoGtCPWg__original/img/9NqkDmUrzhYEOAOHGRE4zU6W71U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5638086.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"2F-Spiele","designer":"Friedemann Friese","artist":"Harald Lieske","honors":"2020 Golden Geek Medium Game of the Year Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3,5],"avgRating":7.55842,"avgWeight":3.1364},{"bggId":39953,"name":"A Game of Thrones: The Card Game","description":"This entry is for the Living Card Game (LCG) that was developed from the Collectible Card Game (CCG).

A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.<br/><br/>Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.<br/><br/>Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) <br/>    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) <br/>    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry <br/>    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids<br/>    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French <br/>    French blockades to confound British plans<br/>    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort<br/>    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety <br/>    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. <br/><br/><br/>Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!<br/><br/>As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.<br/><br/>As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?<br/><br/>As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.<br/><br/>As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.  Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available.

In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.<br/><br/>The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.<br/><br/>Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.

It's the year 2415. The interplanetary federation (IPF) has done a great job in the last centuries. All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &quot;Steam&quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.<br/><br/>But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.<br/><br/>Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lwHHsQY7ej48gRR08yLKMQ__thumb/img/Qmmoyno4oj-v8CqWYSwlv7GOyuI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1639600.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lwHHsQY7ej48gRR08yLKMQ__original/img/qTxAtURdmG99z3Q9E7l14q1_yos=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1639600.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"LudoArt Verlag","designer":"Heinz-Georg Thiemann","artist":"David Ardila, Chris Beck, Czarnè, Ian McQue, Brian Schomburg","honors":"2009 Golden Geek Best Board Game Artwork/Presentation Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.11353,"avgWeight":3.7588},{"bggId":61692,"name":"Axis & Allies Europe 1940","description":"Axis &amp; Allies Europe 1940, a deluxe edition of Axis & Allies: Europe, includes neutral countries which can be invaded.

It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is driven by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.<br/><br/>Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.<br/><br/>The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.<br/><br/>From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and different play styles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...<br/><br/>The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest?

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.<br/><br/>Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way, some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn, the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.<br/><br/>The country boards are also noteworthy, in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn, and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer, after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.<br/><br/>A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.<br/><br/>In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.<br/><br/>A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with &quot;character&quot; keyples and keypers will also be released.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oCUaeYsSQ8S9F55Ft4P0HQ__thumb/img/QjeQLseJRhzJVQoXQK_cedejAlc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3690708.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oCUaeYsSQ8S9F55Ft4P0HQ__original/img/_ZYAiHVrtT8V0h7kzSkLgt2t-M8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3690708.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"R&D Games","designer":"Richard Breese","artist":"Vicki Dalton","honors":"2017 Meeples' Choice Nominee","bestPlayers":[2,3],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":7.3035,"avgWeight":3.6034},{"bggId":332686,"name":"John Company: Second Edition","description":"In John Company, players assume the roles of ambitious families attempting to use the British East India Company for personal gain. The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.<br/><br/>John Company is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.<br/><br/>John Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players.

The fears deep within one&rsquo;s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity. Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp. Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft&rsquo;s work and the Alien series. In the game, players assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event. Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.<br/><br/>Deep Madness is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals. From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat. With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness. Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed. Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase.<br/><br/>In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness. As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side. These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.<br/><br/>In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms. Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly.<br/><br/>Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately. Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act.<br/><br/>In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved.<br/><br/>In each investigator&rsquo;s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely. Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness. Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious. Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions. Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate. Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.<br/><br/>Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn. In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors. Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges. And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different. However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy.<br/><br/>In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness. They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc. However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low. After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens. As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RAaKHdR-UqEN2Xd-j4NhNw__thumb/img/-x1GSZVk9e5bNhrqLYJvdRASZeY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4332309.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RAaKHdR-UqEN2Xd-j4NhNw__original/img/xmqJ2rr8CBgYoLYhWm88e210Bmo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4332309.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Diemension Games","designer":"Chauncey, Roger Ho","artist":"Roberto Chaudon, Joseph Diaz, DRock-ART, Gautier Giroud, Gaël Goumon, Stef Kopinski, Guillem H.

The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?<br/><br/>In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.<br/><br/>Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanic.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The task cards are then shuffled with all the other players.  So each player doesn't know the exact order of play, only which two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn.<br/><br/>In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services.  The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.<br/><br/>The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6aRvs9U-vs5r011ThWSQg__thumb/img/fhY4NZvF6g0i5S_9Ee2QNE3aNK0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic106710.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6aRvs9U-vs5r011ThWSQg__original/img/1UamODjYQIylF2f1rfb2QJejsnc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic106710.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Derek Carver, Pierre Cléquin, Bruno Faidutti, Corey Konieczka","artist":"John Gravato, Tomasz Jedruszek, Robert Lazzaretti, Francis Tsai","honors":"2006 Golden Geek Best Wargame Nominee","bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3,6],"avgRating":6.86844,"avgWeight":3.5019},{"bggId":229491,"name":"Edge of Darkness","description":"Edge of Darkness is the third Card Crafting Game from Alderac Entertainment Group designed by John D. Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style board game of 60 to 120 minutes for 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Players are the heads of powerful guilds in the City. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the City in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.<br/><br/>The Guilds exert their control in the city by sending agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of the City. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to the City's infrastructure.<br/><br/>To win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the City such as defending it from external and internal threats.<br/><br/>Here are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:<br/><br/><br/>     Card Crafting: Similar to the original card-crafting game, Mystic Vale, all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on one third (1/3) of the slip and are transparent on the other two thirds (2/3). During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). However, unlike Mystic Vale, the transparent cards are double-sided, and when you upgrade the &quot;good&quot; side of the cards (front), you also add strength to the &quot;bad&quot; side of the cards (back).<br/>     Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: Rather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different cards in that deck. Using other players' cards means you have to pay them. During the game you can claim allegiance of more cards in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal.<br/>     Card-driven worker placement: While your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. Advancements don't have a cost, instead they require the use of workers to a greater or lesser degree depending on the power of the card. e.g. many effects require placing or pulling workers from different city locations as dictated by the card effects. Since you have a limited number of workers to use, you will constantly be choosing to forgo one useful thing in order to do another.<br/>     Threat Tower:  There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and whom Threats will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Threat Board, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes of a given color accumulate on a card, it attacks the City. If the color matches one of the players, it attacks that player. If the color is black, it attacks all players!<br/>     Modular set up: Edge of Darkness will come with 12 Locations. Each game you use only 10 of these Locations, which can be specifically selected or chosen randomly, making for a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you will need to employ. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Crafting Slips. Location Boards may specify special rules for worker placement, or extend the basic rules with all new systems. For example, a combination of Location Boards can be used to assemble a party of heroes to take the fight to the Threat Tower and engage in a Monster Hunt!<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DyesLCFFkjOKcJXqa_ySNg__thumb/img/ScXmjOSuZhbfM7ZOjnvla_BxyZY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3691121.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DyesLCFFkjOKcJXqa_ySNg__original/img/lZGYYptmZBr3EfgOXlV64FeoJXM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3691121.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Alderac Entertainment Group","designer":"John D.

The game is named after the daughter (or granddaughter) of Cyaxares, the king of the Medes, who married King Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of Babylon. The myth says that Amytis' homesickness for the forested mountains of the Median Empire led to the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as Nebuchadnezzar attempted to please her by planting the trees and plants of her homeland.<br/><br/>The players embody noble Babylonians in quest of prestige.

Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.<br/><br/>VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.<br/><br/>Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.<br/><br/>VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.<br/><br/>Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor!

During this period, Francesco D&rsquo;Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare.<br/><br/>The players will have to do their part in the creation of this new language!

Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope.

Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:<br/><br/><br/>    Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies.<br/>    Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.<br/>    Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.<br/>    Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.<br/>    Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.<br/><br/><br/>There is no &quot;Alien player&quot; in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.<br/>    Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.<br/><br/><br/>The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system &quot;recalibrates&quot; the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.<br/><br/>The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.<br/>    The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.<br/><br/><br/>With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new &quot;alien signals&quot; that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6A8ht1ovDtXLLaaqtr91HQ__thumb/img/UDhl0HmXGhhYpu7pA2CmyzlNemc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1798823.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6A8ht1ovDtXLLaaqtr91HQ__original/img/ouEf3jw0SVAtDyEjOu439S2q_UY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1798823.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Gremlin Project","designer":"Simone Romano, Nunzio Surace","artist":"Mario Barbati, Fernando Peniche, Simone Romano, Raffaele Stumpo, Nunzio Surace","honors":"2014 Board Game Quest Awards Best Tactical/Combat Game Nominee","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4,5],"avgRating":7.44971,"avgWeight":3.2205},{"bggId":272682,"name":"Expedition to Newdale","description":"Expedition to Newdale is the new Oh my Goods! game from renowned designer Alexander Pfister. In this board game adaption of the successful card game, 1 to 4 players from 12 and up compete in different chapters to experience the world of the Longsdale kingdom once again. The story of Expedition to Newdale starts about five years after the events from Oh my Goods! Escape to Canyon Brook, but you don&rsquo;t need to know the prequels at all. Each chapter of the game lasts about 90 minutes which adds up to around 12 hours of exciting campaign gameplay. And when you found your favorite chapter while playing the campaign, you can always come back and play it again to have even more fun!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you have your personal board, a coal mine as your start building and 5 hand cards. Depending on which chapter you are playing, the appropriate game board sits in the middle of the table. Each round is divided into 5 phases which are played in order (or partially parallel, once you become more familiar with the game). In phase 1, a new event is revealed which usually alters the course of play in this round slightly (e. g., by introducing new buildings). Additionally the event card shows a fixed amount of workers which are available this round. An information which is much appreciated, as you have to place your action markers in phase 2. The latter are numbered 1 &mdash; 4 which is important for phase 4 and means that you need to plan ahead. But first phase 3: in this phase, more workers are drawn from a bag and get added to the others. This means that productions which would have been impossible before (because workers were missing) are now easily done. Pushing your luck might be beneficial! Phase 4 is the opposite to phase 2. Instead of placing your workers, you resolve their chosen action in order of their numbers. We hope you had a backup plan in place if your desired workers were not drawn in phase 3, because this can trigger an unpleasant chain of events! Not enough workers could mean that a production does not happen, which then means that you might not have enough money to build the building with your second action marker. Oh, and your third marker was planned to directly produce in the newly built building? Well, where there is no building, there&rsquo;s no place to produce in, right? Clearly: planning ahead, a little luck and good alternatives are the way to success. In Phase 5, all players can either use a free building action or draw new hand cards. The last phase is used to resolve all buildings which do not need workers, e. g., an automatic coal production or a building which offers the conversion of a certain good to victory points. Afterwards the next round starts, of which you play a total of seven. A final scoring at the end of round seven will then show if you win or lose.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qpGBNV1z2RR8Ed0913Rwlg__thumb/img/1nOwLKOvK_gdpeqjzR7vAoCmy8A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4956399.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qpGBNV1z2RR8Ed0913Rwlg__original/img/3iLwwm5CPojuXw_1UZBDUqzaUw8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4956399.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Lookout Games","designer":"Alexander Pfister","artist":"Klemens Franz","honors":"2019 Meeples' Choice Nominee","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.43851,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":169794,"name":"Haspelknecht: The Story of Early Coal Mining","description":"In Haspelknecht: The Story of Early Coal Mining, the first title in Thomas Spitzer's highly acclaimed Coal Trilogy, the players take upon the role of farmers with opportunities to exploit the presence of coal in their lands in the southern part of the Ruhr region of Germany.<br/><br/>The game is set during a time when the lands were mostly covered with forests and roads were rare.

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.<br/><br/>In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.<br/><br/>After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.<br/><br/>Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.<br/><br/>Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.<br/><br/>Note that the box of this game states is for 2-5 players, but the game actually plays only with 3-5 players.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fntuB839u6K9d51noAE7Jw__thumb/img/wLPGZOB-PxR26Gwc4c8g7LB42WA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1102879.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fntuB839u6K9d51noAE7Jw__original/img/f9GjvhKZ5MhLscPzbLA-Lp5fGWo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1102879.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Queen Games","designer":"Dirk Henn","artist":"Oliver Schlemmer","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.58933,"avgWeight":3.2396},{"bggId":205317,"name":"DOOM: The Board Game","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>DOOM: The Board Game is strategy board game of tactical combat for 2-5 players based on Bethesda and id Software's video game of the same name.

Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game.<br/><br/>This game features the formation of the Canadian Government Railroad, and government loans as well as major obstacles for railroad growth. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player goes bankrupt, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zqZhLWMGNSHmWtRTWHEKYQ__thumb/img/KBxyJcHzMCCUQ5JaVQaFjeE35A8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic159311.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zqZhLWMGNSHmWtRTWHEKYQ__original/img/73fmUuEnpamo0BpxdvoSTJ-eFKM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic159311.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":1995,"publisher":"Mayfair Games","designer":"Bill Dixon","artist":"John Kamacher, Mike Russo, Chris Vande Voort","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3,6],"avgRating":7.50884,"avgWeight":4.2573},{"bggId":131111,"name":"Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Deluxe Set","description":"Codex: Card-Time Strategy is a customizable, non-collectible card game set in the Fantasy Strike universe that's inspired by real-time strategy video games such as Starcraft and Warcraft 3.

As one of the ambitious survivors, you soon learn that the island is home to a multitude of majestic and fiercely territorial dinosaurs. With the cruiser beyond repair, you have no choice but to establish a foothold on the island, withstand the onslaught of the dinosaurs, and sow the seeds of what will one day become a strong and tenacious community capable of discovering the mystery of the island.<br/><br/>Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles introduces the first two episodes in a series of euro-style dice-drafting / dice-placement strategy games. The saga will ultimately consist of four episodes, telling the story of a group of survivors becoming a mighty civilization on a hostile island. As each episode features unique characteristics and a different game feel, they are playable as standalone medium/heavy games but also as a continuous campaign. The theme and story unfolds through evolving game mechanisms across the episodes, also making the rules easier to learn. In the campaign mode, the outcome of each episode influences the next, but the game has no legacy elements and no hidden rules; the whole storyline is infinitely replayable.<br/><br/>In Episode 1, players are striving to develop and protect the foothold town of Perseverance, besieged by the dinosaurs of the island. By building walls, traps and settlements, mounting defenses and partaking in the early political power struggles of a forming community, players gain followers to establish themselves as leaders. Episode 1 introduces the signature dice placement / area majority mechanism that evolves and spans through the series, and also features a defense mechanism against waves of attacking dinosaurs, unique to this episode.<br/><br/>In Episode 2, the survivors have successfully defended the city of Perseverance, completing a massive wall to stop the dinosaur onslaught. Under the guidance of the ship&rsquo;s senior officers, the players now set out to explore the surrounding wilderness, expand the settlement beyond the walls, and chart a path to the mysterious structure on the horizon. This Episode adds new actions to expand the core mechanism and allows for a deep customization of your Leader and faction through dozens of unique skills. The previous episode&rsquo;s defense mechanism evolves into hex-based adventuring and expansion, allowing you to build outposts beyond the city walls, but beware - the dinosaurs are still not your friends...yet.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CH7U514WgN1EMGFYN63KsQ__thumb/img/dozFHWuJhtY-cK5mmMHMwJLth7w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5440227.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CH7U514WgN1EMGFYN63KsQ__original/img/avH1CKrpAYOIO7Kcu0C5Kk_dgVE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5440227.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Mindclash Games","designer":"Richard Amann, Thomas Vande Ginste, Viktor Peter, Wolf Plancke, Dávid Turczi","artist":"Tamás Baranya, István Dányi, Villő Farkas, Márton Gyula Kiss","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":7.86928,"avgWeight":4.2111},{"bggId":58936,"name":"Wars of the Roses: Lancaster vs. York","description":"Two Lancastrians and two Yorkists draft cards that give them control of major towns, nobles, bishops and royal castles. Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r0rOK-QZI1IiUUAYKFkN2g__thumb/img/x9-xbFvex5pQZW0D5PjG2DBRUV8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic577593.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/r0rOK-QZI1IiUUAYKFkN2g__original/img/CH3jNB79mo6itDcS23s4LKmxT-s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic577593.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"999 Games","designer":"Peter Hawes","artist":"Mike Jackson, Ben Nelson","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.36076,"avgWeight":3.1988},{"bggId":215840,"name":"Exit: The Game – The Forbidden Castle","description":"The castle is the highlight of the hike, but hardly have the hikers entered the old walls, when the squeaky doors close.

Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android&rsquo;s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike. Will you play as Louis Blaine, the crooked cop tormented by guilt and loss? Or will you take the role of Caprice Nisei, the psychic clone who struggles to retain her sanity while proving that she&rsquo;s as human as anyone else? Whoever you choose to play, you&rsquo;ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons.<br/><br/>During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action. In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace. To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice. The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game. Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game. If the detective invests enough time in the plot, he/she will be awarded victory points; otherwise, he will suffer penalties.<br/><br/>The game ends when two in-game weeks (12 rounds) have passed. At that point, victory points are awarded based on the aforementioned sectors.

Pendragon &ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.<br/><br/>Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:<br/><br/>Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens.<br/>Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.<br/>Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.<br/>Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ.<br/>Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics.<br/>Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control.<br/>Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation.<br/>Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes.<br/>Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.<br/>Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms.<br/>A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.<br/>Short, medium, and full-length scenarios<br/>Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.<br/><br/>Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:<br/><br/>The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.<br/><br/>The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&mdash;materially or culturally&mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.<br/><br/>The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&mdash;whoever their paymaster&mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.<br/><br/>The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority. But beware that your very advances will help give rise and limit your ability to grapple new powerhouses on the island!<br/><br/>Components: See Wiki below.<br/>Players: 1-4 (includes full solitaire system)<br/>Map: Area Movement<br/>Timescale: about 15 years per campaign between Epoch cards<br/>Designer: Marc Gouyon-Rety<br/>Developer and Series Creator: Volko Ruhnke<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLRPDykUR2JBaPYydpWTRw__thumb/img/bkIkRCI-38_ea0XR-tkJshFcfDA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3697273.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLRPDykUR2JBaPYydpWTRw__original/img/cfRkkmbsGIasY1INxUFUByh8pIU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3697273.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Morgane Gouyon-Rety, Volko Ruhnke","artist":"Rodger B.

You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.<br/><br/>The player who's the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.<br/><br/>After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.<br/><br/>It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies. The event cards provide most of the humor. (The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want). The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions. Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game.<br/><br/>Awards: <br/>Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from &quot;Die Firma&quot;, which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZYKXSv95IxAqOnzjQSu8NQ__thumb/img/-aRvX3O4Jmrj2CfehzvdvcZnux4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic588429.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZYKXSv95IxAqOnzjQSu8NQ__original/img/b8VVjhdDwIda324YZcSo8M3lOaw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic588429.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"eggertspiele","designer":"Bauldric & Friends, Maximilian Maria Thiel","artist":"Fréderic Bertrand, Lars-Arne \"Maura\" Kalusky","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.97804,"avgWeight":3.3551},{"bggId":30658,"name":"Rise of Empires","description":"Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age. War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game.<br/><br/>In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times. All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas.  Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires is divided into three eras. Each era consists of two game turns. The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn. The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn. In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods.<br/><br/>In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly. A full game can be completed in less than three hours.  It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Don't just make history-guide it! Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras. Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful. This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense. Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods.<br/><br/>Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre!

The most unique is selling stock short. Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don&rsquo;t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date. You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase. Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase.

The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance. The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists &ndash; they become possessed by the lust for making this world better. They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their &ndash; great, according to them &ndash; ideas.<br/><br/>Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth &mdash; or as a last resort make them vanish. Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?<br/><br/>From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.<br/><br/><br/>    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them.

When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn. He needs to absorb four magical reserves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Ulrike Freihoff &ndash; spreads her religion. When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.<br/><br/><br/>There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.<br/><br/>The game may end in one of the three ways:<br/><br/>    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,<br/>    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,<br/>    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.<br/><br/><br/>INITIATIVE PHASE:<br/>During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.<br/><br/>PLANNING PHASE:<br/>Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.<br/><br/>ACTION PHASE:<br/>Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.<br/>&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.<br/>&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence<br/>&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)<br/>&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region<br/>&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.<br/>&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.<br/>&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.<br/>&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.<br/><br/>DOMINATION PHASE:<br/>Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gn1YR96qXoUhVSbo4SKwvQ__thumb/img/JL4Q92Z4rHdKr7s1i5MTj5SKcf0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2003559.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gn1YR96qXoUhVSbo4SKwvQ__original/img/KZ962YXiZaoLSP47ySmBsM9jerE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2003559.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Giochix.it","designer":"Krzysztof Wolicki","artist":"Dominik Kasprzycki","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.64488,"avgWeight":4.0763},{"bggId":10093,"name":"Axis & Allies","description":"Axis &amp; Allies (2004) aka Axis &amp; Allies Revised Edition is the first Avalon Hill version of the classic light weight war game Axis & Allies.

By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms. Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.<br/><br/>Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.<br/><br/>In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved. Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules.

Play  progresses in a series of alternating stock and operating rounds. During stock rounds, players may purchase and sell stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, the corporations lay track, place railway stations (tokens), run trains for revenue to be withheld or paid out, and purchase trains. The player who owns the most stock in a given corporation makes all decisions for said corporation during an operating round.<br/><br/>The game is notable for the small size of the board compared to many 18xx games, and its innovative game end: The climax of play sees the beginnings of railway nationalization in the United Kingdom, with the weakest companies being eliminated from private operation earlier than those which are the healthiest.<br/><br/>Other notable differences from most 18xx games include:<br/>-Players may own up to 100% of a corporation, and may sell presidents&rsquo; certificates into the bank pool, at which time a corporation goes into receivership and continues to operate.<br/>-Corporations are never required to own trains, and thus player bankruptcy is impossible.

The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.<br/><br/>John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company's history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: Use the Company and the Company's trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end, you guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region's infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...<br/><br/>As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It's even possible that the Company's trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late Company that can be played in about 90 minutes.

Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.<br/><br/>The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.<br/><br/>Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say &quot;I'm a Crab player&quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.<br/><br/>L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.<br/><br/>The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: <br/><br/>     Clan War, a miniatures game.<br/>     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.<br/>     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.<br/>     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game<br/><br/><br/>As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.<br/><br/>In 2008, L5R held the first &quot;Mega-Game&quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.<br/><br/>In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.<br/><br/>Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.<br/><br/>In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.<br/><br/>2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.<br/><br/>In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3wcTdnfvzICO-AESm0v_Q__thumb/img/T3AR3KD14vUbGJA6ODfJTsOMC3s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic151045.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3wcTdnfvzICO-AESm0v_Q__original/img/lXyxMNLwDybyvIrORk7AWQdQ8Hs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic151045.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":1995,"publisher":"Alderac Entertainment Group","designer":"Jeff Alexander, Brent Keith, Bryan Reese, David Seay, Dave Williams (II), Mark Wootton, John Zinser","artist":"Aaron Acevedo, Rob Alexander, Eric David Anderson, Michael Apice, Steve Argyle, Matthew S.

Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.<br/>--<br/>At the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.<br/><br/>A main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game.<br/><br/>On your turn you take two actions: <br/><br/>     Play a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)<br/>     Explore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)<br/>     Populate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)<br/>     Build factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)<br/><br/><br/>In addition you may use power to activate any number of your machines, modifying your actions.<br/><br/>Instead of taking two actions you may Hibernate. This will circulate your cards, moving your played cards to your resting area, and releasing the cards in your resting area back to you. In addition you regain your used power, so that you may activate your machines again.<br/><br/>The multi-use cards play an important role: Each card shows a resource ability (on the top) and a special ability (on the lower part). Playing a card in one of your top slots activates the resource action; In a lower slot you activate the special ability. You may install slot modules in the card slots, and these are activated whenever you play a card matching its color. It is possible to find combinations that lets you chain cards, triggering several slot modules and abilities in one action.<br/><br/>Building factories harness the power of the surrounding terrains, advancing your marker on one of three machine tracks. This may unlock machines that can be activated, using energy.<br/><br/>Reaching certain milestones lets you take an artifact from the main board.

Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players. Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability). By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources. Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags.<br/><br/>Braking sections have a particular feature: here players and robots can try late braking, a dangerous maneuver that allows them to overtake multiple cars simultaneously. Other maneuvers or cards require a &quot;check&quot;, e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target.<br/><br/>Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game. Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions. When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a &quot;special&quot;, which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards.<br/><br/>Race! is a board game with no dice in which strategy and risk melt together to convey a truly intense and deep racing experience.

Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.<br/><br/>The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDu-gDsxSSL49NPK7tfipg__thumb/img/9N_wI7AtLR1qsSEq2MZI18nAA9Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic322925.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDu-gDsxSSL49NPK7tfipg__original/img/3q8CAGuSM98IZ1p4bfAtF2tIx9s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic322925.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1996,"publisher":"Descartes Editeur","designer":"Dominique Ehrhard, Duccio Vitale","artist":"Dominique Ehrhard, Guillaume Rohmer, Duccio Vitale","honors":"1996/Fall Lucca Games Best Original Game","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.86324,"avgWeight":3.0391},{"bggId":316786,"name":"Tabannusi: Builders of Ur","description":"Set in ancient Mesopotamia, a cradle of civilization, at a time when the location of Ur was a coastal region, players work to build the Great City of Ur, expand its districts, and establish themselves as powerful builders.<br/><br/>Tabannusi: Builders of Ur features a stunning board showing the city of Ur divided into 5 regions, each tied to a specific color die.

This is the age of knights and squires, where chivalry is often spoken of, but rarely practiced. It is a time of both religion and superstition. Educated clerics fervently believe that angels guard the pious, and demons scourge the wicked, while the simpler folk watch the night for signs of werewolves and dragons. The game assumes that all of these are real.<br/><br/>Joan of Arc is a story-driven board game that uses finely-sculpted miniatures and 3D scenery to set the scene for a game of cunning and skill (and a little luck). The game is a combination of interwoven card play, resource management, and position on the board. You will need to master all three to beat the best opponents. Getting your men into the right position, and heading off your enemy, will be no use if you cannot muster the cards and other resources to make the most of it. Joan of Arc allows a huge amount of freedom in your actions. In every turn, you can choose to spend or save resources, and when you come to activate a unit you can choose between combat, interrogation, search, exploration, prayers, and other actions. So, this turn, should you level up a hero, or spend that resource to buy a re-roll? Take extra actions now, or save them for later? Double-move that cavalry, or question the old woman in the woods? When and how to act are decisions you must make based on your objectives, and the situation on the board. And, what is the best decision one turn may be very different in the next.<br/><br/>Players take the role of the various factions in the war, or of some of the supernatural creatures that have emerged from the shadows. The most famous heroes and heroines of the war are all here: the Black Prince, the Dauphin, Falstaff, and, of course, Joan of Arc herself. Each game is a unique scenario with its own map assembled from the gaming tiles, and a specified set of heroes and followers to achieve the scenario&rsquo;s objectives. Each scenario has its own victory conditions, often different for each side. In one game you may be an inquisitor, seeking out a werewolf hidden among the peasantry; in another you may be a victorious raiding party, desperately fighting your way through an ambush so you can return to the safety of your castle.<br/><br/>Scenarios range from small affairs with a few models and simplified role-play elements, to full battles with dozens of knights, archers and men-at-arms. All scenarios typically play in under an hour. The game also includes a battle mode, to fight out conflicts between armies of your choosing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RXW72TB3InQq_fyXMAuOUQ__thumb/img/PBccemJI6N2_3cjWeqVGsLA9XR4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3726803.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RXW72TB3InQq_fyXMAuOUQ__original/img/OT3zGLs8HStKMeFc7FrBDwlscbo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3726803.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Mythic Games","designer":"Pascal Bernard","artist":"David Demaret, Julien Fenoglio, Stéphane Gantiez, Nicolas Jamme, Stef Kopinski, Bayard Wu","honors":"2019 Charles S.

Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).<br/><br/>Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.<br/><br/>The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.<br/><br/>There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.<br/><br/>As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.

Each artwork requires money and resources to complete. To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents&rsquo; districts. Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church. During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks. Prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player&rsquo;s primary source of victory points.<br/><br/>All of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance.

The artworks the players can complete include the masterpieces of some of the most famous artists in the world.<br/><br/>Note from the designers directly from the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;We apologize if we included some characters in the game who never worked in Florence during the Renaissance, but we wanted to include all of the most important artists (in our opinion) from that golden age of Italian art and culture. Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city&mdash;and the Renaissance period&mdash;even if he was only in Florence for a short time. We also added some portraits of military leaders (created by Ivan Zoni) to the rulebook. They are not involved in the game, but they were influential members of public life during this era.<br/>The names of the buildings, parts of the Cathedral, and the workshops are in the literal form they had in Italy during the 1400-1600 period. Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&rsquo;t know.

Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs. In this city, you can buy and exchange everything. This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market. Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items. They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!<br/><br/>Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader. While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor. Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.  Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace.<br/><br/>Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.  Each round begins with the marketplace phase. Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.  Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.  Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.  Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.  An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.  After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income.  Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents.  The price for placing agents depends on the location.  Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.<br/><br/>Each round concludes with selling phase.  Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village.  Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game.  Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house. Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in. Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round. End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9X8h1wU5gHxLq1EfYZI_5A__thumb/img/fjy1iIepXtAjmizISJYF82a0HYc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic143036.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9X8h1wU5gHxLq1EfYZI_5A__original/img/yWodKi08c7Cz3m3AyxWaIYZXvAY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic143036.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Mind the Move","designer":"Emanuele Ornella","artist":"Czarnè","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.89726,"avgWeight":3.176},{"bggId":71906,"name":"Castaways","description":"You've been shipwrecked on a deserted isle.

Their main goal is to establish a broad and secure trading network to deliver the tea to the farthest provinces, doing it better than their opponents. The main work behind the scenes is done in Pu'er, their home location: New traders need to be trained, better horses need to be acquired, and a good number of border passes need to be requested to be able to reach the farthest provinces.<br/><br/>Mere trading is not enough to beat the competition, however. Great social influence and a prestigious tea house may come in handy to propitiate the province inspector. Bridges provide shortcuts, and trading posts in faraway places secure one's own path along the Tea-Horse Road.<br/><br/>Yunnan is well-suited for players who like tactical development games.

Each player controls a two-mile-tall, immortal, invulnerable frog-like creature that exists solely to gather terrain from the Shards of Aeth, the fragments of a long-ago shattered world. The First Ones seek to use the lands from the Shards to reconstruct the world of Aeth, and your frogs are their terrain harvesters.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, your frogs descend from the Aether, the cosmic sea between the worlds, onto a terrain-rich Shard of Aeth. Once on the Shard, you harvest land and store it in your massive gullet. When your gullet is sufficiently full, you leap into the Aether and disgorge your gullet contents into your inter-dimensional vault for permanent storage, then return to the Shard to collect more land. Although your frogs' collective mission is to gather as much land as possible for the First Ones, your private goal is to prove yourself to be the greatest of their harvesters by delivering to them the most valuable vault. To do this, you have to fill your vault strategically in a manner that both maximizes linear sets of identical lands and maximizes the diversity of lands in your vault at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you're free to keep to yourself and focus on harvesting at your own pace...or you may attack other frogs and try to take lands directly from their gullets. You may even raid another frog's vault and steal the lands they have gathered if they have been knocked into the dreaded Outer Dimensions. As you are all immortal and invulnerable, no frog is ever wounded or killed &mdash; just irritated and inconvenienced.<br/><br/>But don't ever get too comfortable with your carefully crafted plans as the Aether is a chaotic and unstable place. Waves of Aether Flux will prompt you to mutate, and you may have to change your strategy in accordance with your new powers. And Splinters of Aeth, tiny slivers of the old world that swirl madly about in the Aether, will periodically fall from their orbit and crash into the Shard, destroying large areas of terrain and blasting apart the very Shard itself!<br/><br/>The game ends when the Shard is stripped of all harvestable land or when a Splinter shatters it. When the game ends, the player with the highest valued vault wins, and the frogs move to the next Shard to gather more land for the First Ones...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AIpQGJA6fG1ArnX-5F1tsA__thumb/img/Cf6BQt9HI1bFg1abueAWUZK4oPE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5278075.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AIpQGJA6fG1ArnX-5F1tsA__original/img/oZz18WcyOVNt0eVzq8Y-kbVauAw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5278075.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Devious Weasel Games","designer":"Jim Felli","artist":"Tim Barton, Jim Felli, Chad Hoverter, Tani Pettit, Naomi Robinson","honors":"2020 Cardboard Republic Immersionist Laurel Nominee","bestPlayers":[6],"goodPlayers":[3,4,5],"avgRating":7.45018,"avgWeight":3.0263},{"bggId":31759,"name":"BattleTech: Introductory Box Set","description":"The Introductory Box Set was designed as the entry point into the game for new BattleTech players, allowing them to slug it out in thirty-foot-tall war machines known as BattleMechs.

At the start of play, you receive a number of Province cards at random, then mark your initial positions with town pieces. Shuffle these Province cards with a set of five Initial cards to form your starting deck, then draw a hand of five cards. The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game.<br/><br/>Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card. The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels. Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads. As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play.<br/><br/>On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards. Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province. To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses.<br/><br/>Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards. Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource. You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve. You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces. Castles increase the defensive value of a province.<br/><br/>All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province. Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card. For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the &quot;Roadside Inns&quot; VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP. You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters. The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pk-IBl84HBPZWZQgQWkCpQ__thumb/img/a3sfzRClZ7sfj4Jyq6SJ8TdCQto=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2257592.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pk-IBl84HBPZWZQgQWkCpQ__original/img/u22VUm-pgFA90Qppcc-XOJGeYvU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2257592.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Treefrog Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Sanjana Baijnath","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.81507,"avgWeight":3.0882},{"bggId":237179,"name":"Weather Machine","description":"&ldquo;Natural disasters will soon be a thing of the past!&rdquo; proclaimed Professor S&ecirc;ni Lativ, Project Chief of Meteorological Manipulation at Lightning Technologies.

Napoleon's France enjoys a superb army, central position, superior leadership, and a useful, if not powerful, ally in Spain. However, she faces three foes.<br/><br/>Napoleon must beware of Britain's seapower and wealth, Austria's threatening position, and Russia's reinforcing hordes. In the wings, Prussia, Turkey, and Sweden teeter on the brink of war, begging inducements to join either side.

It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.<br/><br/>TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame, that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.<br/><br/>THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.<br/><br/>THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.<br/><br/>THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.<br/><br/>THE KAMPFGRUPPE 03 are the heirs to the Order of Marduk - and same as their spiritual ancestors in medieval times, dragonslayers Siegfried and Georg, they strive for a world unburdened by TSUKUYUMI'S existence.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win. <br/> After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.<br/><br/>According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.<br/>Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.<br/><br/>Each round consists of the following phases:<br/>White Phase: Players use the white action card they chose to emphasize their strategy.<br/>Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.<br/>Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.<br/>Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game.

His last conscious action on his deathbed was composing the Lacrimosa movement of his Opus Requiem. You, as one of his sponsors, will meet with the widow in order to participate one last time in the funding of the works of the Austrian genius. Also, you will reminisce and retell all your memories alongside Mozart in order to make sure that she portrays you under the best light when writing her memoirs in order to enter history as Mozart's most important patron.<br/><br/>In Lacrimosa, players take the roles of patrons of the late musician, contributing with their fundings to the composer's works one last time. During the game, you play in two different timelines: the present and the past. In the present, you commission the missing parts of the Requiem from other composers in order to complete it. When developing past events, the game takes place in five epochs in which you contribute by buying new compositions from the composer to sell or exhibit, accompany him on the different journeys through the main courts and theaters in Europe, and gather the resources you need in order to support the musician during his career.<br/><br/>During the game, you play cards from a limited hand that you will improve as the game progresses. These cards can be played either as actions or as resource generators, and players need to optimize their resources and finances in order to support their best version of the story and their relationship with Mozart.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0aS85HPSKKGHGVvWQEEZew__thumb/img/Vxx4SHednYKXpDMP6eHTK9DqmSc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6795274.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0aS85HPSKKGHGVvWQEEZew__original/img/Ww2bs-arDFMqVhte3VOtmGlq_SQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6795274.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Devir","designer":"Gerard Ascensi, Ferran Renalias","artist":"Jared Blando, Enrique Corominas","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.84189,"avgWeight":3.0735},{"bggId":282435,"name":"1882: Assiniboia","description":"In 1882, the CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILROAD pioneered railway construction in the territorial region of Assiniboia, an area now divided up across the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board.  One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.<br/><br/>Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.<br/><br/>There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.<br/><br/>When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.<br/><br/>When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.<br/><br/>Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).<br/><br/>Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.<br/><br/>One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z0XUOK08tRPSL9t6AypO2w__thumb/img/FSjEPxttSY8rvIxQzj6Th8cwrfM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic217481.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z0XUOK08tRPSL9t6AypO2w__original/img/WZJ-BnYBnbQ-05mKnPD8tFiOSDE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic217481.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"R&D Games","designer":"Richard Breese","artist":"Juliet Breese, Mike Doyle (I)","honors":"2009 Games Magazine Best New Advanced Strategy Game Winner","bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":6.72131,"avgWeight":3.0209},{"bggId":268012,"name":"Chronicles of Drunagor: Age of Darkness","description":"Daren has always been a land mired in conflict &ndash; from the moment the Mortal Races met in its rolling hills, tall peaks and primeval forests, there was bound to be strife between its wary peoples. With the discovery of Magic, however, came the potential for dramatic change in the world &ndash; for good or evil. Centuries after the discovery of the Art, magic has shaped the fears and hopes of countless people, and the heroes and villains that wield it have decided the fate of nations over all these years. Yet for all this struggle, a tenuous balance remained between those who seek to strengthen all Mortal Races and those that seek to lord over them. Little do they know however that amidst the shadowed boughs of the Dead Irall, an ancient evil seeks to rule once again. Few are aware that the fate of the land now lies with brave heroes who are the only ones who can prevent the oncoming Age of Darkness.<br/><br/>Chronicles of Drunagor - Age of Darkness is a fully cooperative and strategy board game of tactical combat in a dungeon crawl adventure for one to five players. CoD-AoD is based on multiple 3D scenarios, each of them played separately or on a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique setup, darkness rules and different goals that will be needed to be achieved in order to obtain victory. Played over a series of rounds until either the chosen adventure objective is achieved by the heroes or a single hero dies or is corrupted by the darkness itself. The order of activation is dictated by the initiative track and it alternates between heroes, monsters and the darkness itself. Once they all activate, a round is over and a new one begins, so players win or lose as a team. The game is won when the adventure objectives are met. The game is lost when one player is either killed or corrupted by darkness.<br/><br/>On a hero&rsquo;s turn he can freely move up to 3 spaces (orthogonal and or diagonal are permitted) and spend 2 of his action cubes to trigger his abilities. If when passing his turn he no longer has any cubes on his available action cubes pool, he must perform a recall action. On a monster activation he will always move to attack the heroes. Or if he`s in range of his target he will attack without even move. Each monster has its own primary target located on his card at the initiative track. On the darkness activation, draw from the bag the number of darkness tokens dictated by the chosen adventure and follow the darkness rules for that adventure.<br/><br/>As you go by the different adventures, your heroes will find themselfs in a wide variety of scenarios and instead of only reading thru the descriptions of the place you are, the game will show you beautifull illustrations of what you can see and how you can interact with the scenario. Every choice on how you interact with certain things could possibly change the way your adventure continues.

Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.<br/><br/>Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &quot;rate&quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.<br/><br/>This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.<br/><br/>Included within the game are historical scenarios [...]. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios using point values for each ship.

This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.<br/><br/>During the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.<br/><br/>Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.<br/><br/>Historically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.<br/><br/>This game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control.

They promised knowledge for any willing to learn. Come, Archon, guide your citizens to victory, under the watchful eyes of the Builders, our benefactors from beyond the skies above.<br/><br/>In Origins: First Builders, you are an archon, guiding a population of freemen, influencing the construction of buildings and monuments, climbing the three mighty zodiac temples, and taking part in an arms race &mdash; all in an effort to leave the greatest mark on mankind's ancient history.<br/><br/>You start the game with a city consisting of just two building tiles: the Agora tile and the Palace tile. As the game develops, your city will grow in both size and strength as you add new building tiles, each of which has a special ability that triggers when it is first added to a city and when closing a district. Your placement on the military track indicates the rewards you receive when you attack and your chances of becoming first player.<br/><br/>Origins: First Builders is played over a number of rounds, with a round ending only after each player has passed. If a game end condition has not yet been triggered, the game continues with a new round. On your turn, you perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&bull; Visit an encounter site with your workers to gain resources and additional citizen or speaker dice, advance on the zodiac temple tracks (and potentially gain zodiac cards), and advance and attack on the military track.<br/><br/>&bull; Close a district, gaining victory points (VPs) and possibly gold for matching a district card's building pattern, additional bonuses based on the buildings you activate, and additional VPs at the end of the game based on the value of the citizen die you use to close the district.<br/><br/>&bull; Build a tower level to increase your endgame scoring based on the tower heights and the matching color dice you use to close your districts.<br/><br/>&bull; Grow your population.<br/><br/>&bull; Pass.<br/><br/>The game finishes at the end of the round when one or more of the following conditions has been met:<br/><br/>    At most three colors of tower disks are still in stock.<br/>    No gold remains above any district card.<br/>    No citizen die of the proper color can be added to the citizen offer.<br/>    A player has moved all three of their zodiac disks to the top space of each temple track.<br/><br/><br/>The temple area is divided into three tracks: the sea temple, the forest temple, and the mountain temple.

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.<br/> First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).<br/><br/>With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tj4tIPBtdLy1_7N6O4pDoQ__thumb/img/RChOf469MwxQ5-L-CMOx40QqEvo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic910745.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tj4tIPBtdLy1_7N6O4pDoQ__original/img/UHjNtwcGlgL4VOSt48r2ndHVuSU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic910745.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Argentum Verlag","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Dennis Lohausen","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.05107,"avgWeight":3.1758},{"bggId":200890,"name":"Pixie Queen","description":"Pixie Queen is a smoothly playing worker-placement game about a pixie queen who rules over her subordinates like a true tyrant.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!<br/><br/>Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).<br/><br/>Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.<br/><br/>Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).<br/><br/>The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.<br/><br/>All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &quot;do you develop your grain productivity &ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).<br/><br/>When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).<br/><br/>Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_JBSpZ1lj4jyD-RY1-mJw__thumb/img/yLElRHA-YOI2yX0o4kX7UfS4fAo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1280009.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_JBSpZ1lj4jyD-RY1-mJw__original/img/r_ZN5PTjX8inkciH6NH1Za9jvRw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1280009.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"Stratelibri","designer":"Andrea Chiarvesio, Luca Iennaco","artist":"Antonio Dessi","honors":"2010 Lucca Games Best Boardgame","bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.81066,"avgWeight":3.009},{"bggId":181797,"name":"Inhabit the Earth","description":"Inhabit the Earth is a race game played on six continent boards.

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.<br/><br/>Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.<br/><br/>Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.<br/><br/>Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.

Then, using these heroes, players compete to take control of the lanes and lead the minions there to assault the enemies towers, or enter the dome to take control of the outsider there. In doing so, they will win one of the three victory conditions selected at the start of the game, allowing for potential bluffing or feints by switching objective.<br/><br/>Skytear is diceless, instead revolving around modifiers printed on every power cards. This duality of effect means deckbuilding is a nuanced issue: cards that are most beneficial when played (and likely will) come with a negative modifier, reducing the effectiveness of most attacks. At the same time, drafting a particular hero provides you with their associated cards, meaning flexibility can be integrated into your hero selections.<br/><br/>With two maps, 28 heroes, and over 65 power cards at launch, Skytear is an extremely replayable tactical experience.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rVvI9IAPEw8UEydG1bucAg__thumb/img/BvPjHE8i7pHEop5nru8D1b-dn0c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5396946.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rVvI9IAPEw8UEydG1bucAg__original/img/xOW2tP-h22c-xDj41_28CAGVrTM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5396946.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"PvP Geeks","designer":"Riccardo Neri, Giacomo Neri, Riccardo Parmeggiani","artist":"Anca Albu, Bogdan Antoci, Rafael Dioli, Marko Fiedler, Jack Kaiser, Francesco Orrù, Alba Palacio, Kim Van Deun","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":8.09403,"avgWeight":3.2826},{"bggId":83734,"name":"Strike of the Eagle","description":"WWI has ended, but the battle for democracy has just begun. Communist movements have sprung up throughout Europe. Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin plan to blast through Poland in order to support the red revolutions in Germany, France and England. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Strike of the Eagle models the battles and historical events of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.<br/><br/>To simulate the tension of the era from the fog of war, players alternate placing secret orders on their armies in order to bluff, mislead and misdirect their opponents. These concealed orders make it difficult to deduce an opponent's plans and are used to hide a player's true intentions and objectives. Players then reveal and resolve the issued orders. They can then disrupt their opponent's moves, cut off supply and much more. Once orders are resolved the next turn begins.<br/><br/>Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, but with a simple and quick combat system.<br/><br/>Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle's resolution.[...]<br/><br/>Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.<br/><br/>The map portrays a portion of Eastern Europe in 1920. It is divided into areas that are named after local cities to simplify scenario setups. Along the outer edge of the map is a grid to help find areas during game setup. Each area name is followed by its grid location.<br/>The map is divided into two fronts; the northern and the southern. The front line is designated by a yellow line that runs from east to west. In 4 player scenarios, each allied player commands blocks on one front only. If a block of one player crosses the line between fronts, it moves to the control of his ally at the beginning of the next Operation Phase.<br/><br/>The Fog of War series is a card driven game where Divisions and Brigades are represented as blocks. These blocks stand upright during the game to prevent opponents from knowing their strength or unit type and can only be revealed during combat or through Recon Area orders given during each Operation Phase.<br/><br/>Strike of the Eagle is divided into a number of Rounds, each Round being subdivided into a number of identical phases. The Round Phase Track marks the game's progression. Each round is divided into the Replenish Cards Phase, five identical Operation Phases, and a Reinforcement Phase.<br/>Each side has a pool of order counters to draw from. These order counters represent the various types of orders each unit or group may be given. These orders, which range from Forced Marches to Reconnaissance actions, allow the player to strategically manouver his Divisions and Brigades. Orders are placed face down, leading to guesswork and strategic anticipation on the part of your opponent!<br/><br/>The sequence of placing and executing orders is determined by the player(s) with the higher initiative. Each front has its own initiative track. Initiative is gained and lost as the game progresses. Whether to place first or second is an important strategic element of the game!<br/><br/>Strike of the Eagle is a card driven game. Each card is broken up into a number of different parts and each card can be played for either its event as listed in the body of the card, to increase the number of orders available in a phase (uppermost left), for the combat value on the card (uppermost right), or for reinforcements (lowermost left).<br/><br/>Supply is important in Stike of the Eagle. If units are out of supply they will fight less well, take much greater losses, and lose the advantage of any Garrison which might be located at their city.<br/><br/>(from Academy Games website)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C7pFct-PVrGWJIQ72gnNCA__thumb/img/8F34DR-g2dNPVFVrMqKsMQ7aFpY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic967310.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C7pFct-PVrGWJIQ72gnNCA__original/img/pciahlIFoNZ5bDmnxxrOK6xElbk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic967310.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2011,"publisher":"Academy Games, Inc.","designer":"Brian Bennett, Uwe Eickert, Robert Żak","artist":"Jarek Nocoń, Steve Paschal","honors":"2011 Charles S.

You will try to achieve influence and prestige for your family. You will grow your family's estate, earn the queen's favor, bear witness to scandalous behavior, gain influence with the church, bribe royalty, and leverage your political weight during masquerade balls, all in an effort to ensure your family's rightful place in history.

The game is the first game published by R&amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.<br/><br/>Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.<br/><br/>After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.<br/><br/>Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.<br/><br/>David Brain&rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.  But for those looking for a challenging medieval resource management/economic engine game, here you are.&rsquo;<br/><br/>The game is for two to four players, with a game time of approximately 30 minutes plus 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>Key Market was released at the Essen Spiel in October 2010 as a limited edition of 900 copies.

Howard (creator of Conan), Solomon Kane is a narrative adventure board game featuring exceptional 35mm miniatures. It is a highly innovative co-operative game of storytelling, resource management, and tactical miniatures play. Players take the part of the invisible powers of good and light who aid Solomon Kane in his quest to overcome the forces of Darkness. Each player is one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with special powers that reflect their unique role.<br/><br/>Drawing upon Howard&rsquo;s famous tales of the Puritan avenger, the core box allows players to tell their own versions of the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, and Blue Flame of Vengeance. Expansions recreate Howard&rsquo;s other Solomon Kane stories, as well as adding original adventures for the hero, created especially for the game.<br/><br/>In Solomon Kane, each of Howard&rsquo;s tales is told as one or more Acts, with each Act comprising a full game session. Shorter stories like Rattle of Bones can be completed in a single session, whilst longer tales will take multiple sessions to play through.<br/><br/>An Act is broken down into 8-10 Chapters, and each Chapter has multiple possible outcomes depending upon the actions of the players. Some Chapters offer story choices, whereas others see the action play out on the game board as the players work together to aid Solomon Kane in his quest.<br/><br/>Using custom card decks and dice, each Virtue can control Solomon Kane or his allies, moving them around the board, fighting enemies, exploring locations, and interrogating suspects for information. If the odds get too stacked against Solomon Kane, the Virtues can even manifest directly to intervene on the board.<br/><br/>Opposing Solomon Kane and the players is the Darkness. This twisted reflection of the Virtues is controlled by an AI deck which determines the actions of enemy miniatures, thwarts the player&rsquo;s best plans, and competes with them to drive the story in an evil and unholy direction.<br/><br/>The world of Solomon Kane is brought to life through the stunning artistic vision of Guillem H. Pongiluppi and game designer Jake Thornton, whose &lsquo;puppet master&rsquo; game mechanics break new ground in co-operative gameplay. With multiple versions of every single Chapter, Solomon Kane is able to combine immersive storytelling with abundant replayability for a truly unique gameplay experience.<br/><br/>Who is Solomon Kane?<br/>Solomon Kane is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs. He roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest.<br/><br/>All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa &ndash; even to the shores of the distant New World of America. He neither knows nor questions why is driven to do this. It simply must be done.<br/><br/>To Solomon Kane he is the fulfiller of God&rsquo;s judgment; a vessel of wrath to be emptied onto the souls of the unrighteous. To his enemies he is an implacable fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R9D3SS_Dehl1JR2hspQT_w__thumb/img/zIVxvqbY8enxz6tf4-4O0Kx6scY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4235874.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R9D3SS_Dehl1JR2hspQT_w__original/img/IN_UUzAdDYNBhy4S3nENyW-SJvU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4235874.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Mythic Games","designer":"Jake Thornton","artist":"Thierry Masson, Guillem H.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.<br/><br/>In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.<br/><br/>Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.<br/><br/>When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.<br/><br/>Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.<br/><br/>NOTE: this description is out-of-date.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dE3dzjw1XEQ4cOZ33heWiw__thumb/img/9pSTauTiI8Sf_0gWIoF0VGljA3M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2721731.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dE3dzjw1XEQ4cOZ33heWiw__original/img/TD3J09ukjPIjF1adqSkALaivkbE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2721731.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Treefrog Games","designer":"Martin Wallace","artist":"Peter Dennis","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.84734,"avgWeight":3.527},{"bggId":17393,"name":"Pax Romana","description":"How did Rome get to be Rome?

The center hex is a vein of yellow gems: place all 9 in a stack there. The rest of the gems go in their individual market areas (priced 1-9 based on supply).Each round (3 in game), add 5 contracts (showing gem combinations; score big VP if completing them; lose some VP if cannot) to the display. Then auction (using VP) turn order chips 1-4. Players then each get the same set of tiles (hexes with various numbers of track exits, prospecting tiles, veins, option tiles, etc.) plus a dynamite hex based on their turn order chip. Take turns taking contracts until everyone passes.<br/><br/>Then, on your turn, play 1-4 of your 12 actions. These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price. The last action is prospecting, where you create a path from one of your stations to another, passing through as many veins as possible: take one gem from each vein.<br/><br/>After everyone's 12 actions are used, any exposed dynamite tracks explode and take the adjacent tracks as well (all these are placed in the Buy Pool, which can be accessed by turning in Option tiles)! You score for stations in cities based on the number of empty hexes. Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price.<br/><br/>At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders.

A second world war can break out at any time. Can you stop it? Will you start it? Better yet, can you win it?<br/><br/>Cataclysm&nbsp;is not your typical game about World War II. The game begins in 1933, not 1939, and is global in scope. Germany is far from dominating Europe. Japan is on the march in Asia. Every crisis is an unexpected opportunity. There is no hindsight and anything can happen.<br/><br/>Truly grand strategic in scope,&nbsp;Cataclysm&nbsp;requires players to lead nations, not just armies or fleets.

Counters representing political actions, military actions, units, and possible events are drawn at random from an action cup. As each counter comes out, the owning player resolves it, and play swiftly moves on to the next draw. You have to make plans to execute when your chance comes up, but you have no idea when, or in what order, events will transpire.<br/><br/>A game about global war gives every nation armies, air forces, and fleets. But in&nbsp;Cataclysm, military pieces have no numeric values. You know what forces you have and where they are deployed. To resolve combat, each side rolls up to three dice and compares their single highest die.&nbsp;You can devote more resources to a campaign (generating more dice or bonuses), but that does not guarantee a favorable outcome.

To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.<br/><br/>Games usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.<br/><br/>Expansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vHlnL14ffK3DZy9LQfgJUQ__thumb/img/vTnyaRdFcj-ZOvUr_MgkKhHAPYU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1447198.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vHlnL14ffK3DZy9LQfgJUQ__original/img/Mf-CRTdrN7k0IDMUPJRIPZlMiRw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1447198.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":1998,"publisher":"Games Workshop Ltd.","designer":"Andy Chambers, Jervis Johnson, Rick Priestley, Gavin Thorpe","artist":"John Blanche","honors":"1999/Fall Lucca Games Best Translated Game","bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":6.51029,"avgWeight":3.4951},{"bggId":206490,"name":"An Infamous Traffic","description":"It&rsquo;s 1833.

Monte Alb&aacute;n was one of the first major cities in Mesoamerica and the center of the Zapotec state that dominated much of the territory that today belongs to the Mexican state of Oaxaca.<br/><br/>In a game of Zapotec, you build temples, cornfields and villages in the three valleys surrounding the capital to generate resources needed for building pyramids, making sacrifices to the gods, and performing rituals.<br/><br/>Each round, players simultaneously pick a card from their hand to determine their turn order and the resources they collect. Players then perform individual turns and spend resources to build new houses, gain access to special abilities, make sacrifices to the gods and build pyramids. The played action card determines three important aspects of each player's turn:<br/><br/><br/>    The resource printed at the top of the card determines the row or column to activate on the resource grid to collect income.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The icon in the middle of the card matches one of the nine properties of the building spaces on the map (one of three building types, one of three regions, or one of three terrain types).

Historically, this epic struggle lasted for 6 months and saw the Axis armies reach the Volga and the Caucasus Mountains. But Soviet resistance stiffened and final victory eluded the German army at Stalingrad and in the Caucasus. The ensuing November Soviet offensive trapped the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s largest army (the 6th) at Stalingrad and marked the beginning of the end for Axis fortunes in World War II.<br/>Stalingrad &rsquo;42 uses the same scale and nearly all the rules of Ukraine '43. Many modifications have been made to improve the system and to show crucial features of the campaign. New rules include leaders, elite panzer divisions, planned operations, hidden Soviet buildup, and Army/Front offensive support. <br/> With four maps and low unit density, the game delivers a grand view of the campaign, where decisions about movement and direction of attack have lasting effects that propel or curtail your future strategic plans. The effect is like watching a story unfold and noticing a growing emotional involvement with your forces and plans. In the end, whether in victory or defeat, players of Stalingrad &rsquo;42 will enjoy an epic gaming experience.<br/><br/>MAP SCALE: 1 hex = 10 miles<br/>TIME SCALE: 1 turn = 3-7 days<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2-4<br/>UNIT SCALE: Small Corps/Divisions/Brigades/Regiments<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>4 Maps (2 full size, 2 small, total footprint 48&quot; x 43.5&quot;)<br/>3 Counter sheets (576 9/16&rdquo; playing pieces)<br/>5 Scenario cards<br/>2 (identical) Player aid cards<br/>1 Rules booklet<br/>1 Playbook with examples of play, design notes, and historical notes<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/>&bull;   Campaign Game: June 28th - December 31st (36 turns)<br/>&bull;   Fall Blau: June 28th - July 28th (8 turns, one full-size map)<br/>&bull;   Caucasus Campaign: August 2nd - November 11th (18 turns, two small maps)<br/>&bull;   Operation Uranus: November 12th - December 31st (9 turns, two full-size maps)<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/>&bull;   Ease of play<br/>&bull;   Accurate Order of Battle<br/>&bull;   Detailed game maps<br/>&bull;   Rules for: Blitzkrieg warfare, Reserves, Offensive Planning, Sea Movement, Leaders, City Battles, North Caucasus Volunteers, and hidden Soviet buildup.<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY OUTLINE<br/>A.

As the new game changes the map of the original, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.<br/><br/>M&eacute;gawatts is the French release of the Friedemann Friese game Power Grid. The French edition is produced by Filosofia.<br/><br/>As with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>It differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.<br/><br/>The Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.<br/><br/>The ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.<br/><br/> Re-Implements: <br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid<br/>     Funkenschlag<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid: France/Italy<br/>     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe<br/>     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)<br/>     Power Grid: The New Power Plant Cards<br/>     Power Grid: China/Korea<br/>     Power Grid: Flux Generator<br/><br/><br/>The expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards.

It is as close and yet far from Chinese Mahjong as Sh&ocirc;gi (Japanese Chess) can be the same and yet different from original Chess. Mahjong was brought to Japan in 1904, but the Riichi form that is used in modern times probably originated from the 1920s. Today, the worldwide famous Mahjong Association officially recognized the complete rules of Riichi Mahjong for Tournaments.<br/><br/>The main differences are :<br/>1) The 1-Yaku minimum: In order to win a hand, it can only be validated when your hand has at least one of the Yaku (specific hand combinations) in it.<br/>2) Dora: A specific bonus tiles are indicated by the flipped tile from the dead wall and providing other possible Han bonus.<br/>3) Riichi: When a player is Tenpai (one tile away from having a Mahjong hand, valid or not), he can bet a 1000 points chip to add one Yaku to his hand (thus validating a possible invalid hand).  Winning with a Riichi hand allows access to the hidden ura-dora, which is an added dora indicator located underneath the revealed dora tile.<br/>4) Abortive draws: Specific conditions, which ends a hand without winning prior to the drawing of all tiles, aside from the dead wall.<br/>5) Scoring system: Much more complex than in Chinese Mahjong, it is based on hand combinations (Yaku) providing multipliers (Han) that combine with some other circumstantial points like the type of tiles in the hand (Fu) for any 4 han or less.  The combination of Han and Fu correspond to a chart (and even an equation) to finally produce the hand's scoring points (Ten).<br/><br/>Some other minor elements in the Riichi Mahjong differ from the original Mahjong but are not important enough to be fully mentioned, like the Red 5 tiles (a non-official variant sometimes used which gives bonus like the Dora) or the validation of some Yaku (when the hand must be kept hidden or not, depending on the Japanese region where the game is played).<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/62j0mEWiwuyZixScOzwEnA__thumb/img/momsWLUZJUTVdxpNbJaCqu-Rxak=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4667546.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/62j0mEWiwuyZixScOzwEnA__original/img/sx6PwhoQPB7ltdxFhtK42Gzq9tE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4667546.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":0,"publisher":"(Public Domain)","designer":"(Uncredited)","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":8.27185,"avgWeight":3.5172},{"bggId":360265,"name":"Sabika","description":"On the hill of Al-Sabika in Granada, the Nasrid dynasty created one of the most impressive constructions in history, the Alhambra.<br/><br/>In Sabika, you play the role of one of the Nasrid nobles who contributed to the construction of the towers, gardens, and palaces of this ancient monument.

In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough.

If your supply lines are set up and the timber has been approved for felling, then the players claim an area using secretly selected cards. Since each of the areas contain differing amounts of food and wood, players must learn to recognize and adapt to their opponent's strategies because if two players are both in the same area, they must share the resources. Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.<br/><br/>The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood.

Each player takes the roles of railroad presidents and their wealthy investors, betting that their capital gambles will pay off handsomely.

World leadership came together to build a massive Flotilla, mankind&rsquo;s last bastion of civilization.<br/><br/>Now, ten years after the disaster, the Flotilla is home to the very last of us.<br/><br/>Flotilla features two distinct and interwoven modes of gameplay, as you try to outpace your opponents in bringing prosperity to humanity&rsquo;s new home. You begin the game as a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; Fleet Commander, commissioned by world leaders to explore the new face of the ocean, scour the depths for resources, and rescue any survivors you come across. At any point in the game, you may choose to turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; by selling your skiffs, and leaving your seafaring life behind to now grow the Flotilla itself.<br/><br/>The choice of if or when to switch from a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; explorer to a &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; settler defines the very core experience of Flotilla. They represent two similar but distinct game experiences, utilizing the same game components, seamlessly intertwined among all players. If you switch, you&rsquo;ll flip over all of your accumulated game components, watching your crew grow into new roles with new art for the same characters, while finding entirely new uses for your ocean tiles and resources, and beginning to trade with the &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; players as you go after new objectives. As players turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; different niches are filled, forever changing the game&rsquo;s economy. Mastering this ebb and flow will be critical if you&rsquo;re to shape the new face of humanity!<br/><br/>As a &ldquo;Sinksider,&rdquo; you will explore the ocean with your skiffs, pulling some of the 92 hexagon-shaped ocean tiles out of a bag, and arranging them to help you effectively collect resources, discover valuable artifacts from the sunken civilization, all while trying to avoid toxic radiation left from the disaster. You&rsquo;ll dive for supplies, rolling a pool of custom dive dice that vary based on the depth level of your skiffs. You&rsquo;ll also carefully manage your resources, trading them on the open market for the currency you can use to buy more skiffs and outposts, or stockpiling them for when you turn &ldquo;Skyside.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As a &ldquo;Skysider,&rdquo; you will use your resources to build an expansive network of watercraft and docks, using the &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; of your ocean tiles. Your divers will also have new jobs as researchers, rolling custom, multicolor Research dice, to discover new technologies that allow the Flotilla to manage a growing population. You&rsquo;ll also build Sonar stations, making life a little easier for the &ldquo;Sinksiders&rdquo; still out exploring the unknown, while earning quite a few points for yourself.<br/><br/>On both sides, you&rsquo;ll also grow your relationships with the four different governing guilds, each giving you unique bonuses and more powerful crew. The players with the strongest relationships will also earn valuable points at the end of the game!<br/><br/>The components in Flotilla are unique, immersive, and interconnected. Your skiffs will be able to actually carry up to four resource barrels, and come in a unique shape for each player color. Artifact tokens slot into matching spaces in a double-layered hub board and art on the ocean tiles lines up to create a unique layout for your growing Flotilla each time you play.<br/><br/>In Flotilla, you&rsquo;ll find significant strategic depth and variety, while giving players the freedom to tell their own story. Will you build the Flotilla by being the first to go Skyside, or stay Sinkside for the whole game, becoming the most powerful seafarer of them all?<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ldSFIyYArYU_iXHRnOF7iA__thumb/img/Uuhmrda91vHNrI0qVMZCEw6c5eQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4653762.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ldSFIyYArYU_iXHRnOF7iA__original/img/xCC6KPlFqBps5Z9UJuIJfZaWE74=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4653762.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"WizKids (I)","designer":"J.B.

The core of the game is trying to acquire &quot;projects of buildings&quot; (cards) that can be automatically transformed in buildings and protection walls (and subsequent upgrades).<br/>The acquisition of the projects is made through a bidding system.<br/>The buildings can be of four types (Economic, Military Cultural and Religious) that give different resources.

At the bidding of the magistracy, scout vehicles are lowered to the barren surface to search for suitable mining areas.<br/><br/>The goal of Magnastorm is to be the first player with a certain number of reputation points. You acquire reputation mostly through fulfilling objectives, taking control of one or more of the eight commanders, and building transmitter stations. The flow of the game is controlled by an action board with two action panels, each of which has five columns. At the start of each round, there are a 3-5 action tokens (crew members) standing in each column on the upper action panel. To carry out an action, a player:<br/><br/>A) takes an action token from the upper panel and places it on the lower action panel either to gain resources or to pay for a movement on the planet surface, or<br/> B) pays for every action token still standing in a certain column on the upper panel to gain control over the commander and his ability at the top of that panel, after which the player places those action tokens on the lower panel.<br/><br/>Since option A) will reduce the cost for option B), the players have to find the right timing for their actions. A round ends when the upper panel is empty. For the next round, the panels are swapped.<br/><br/>Magnastorm is a big, tactical board game with very little luck. Choose the right moment to perform actions or buy influence over helpful commanders. You will reap success through resource management, clever logistics, good timing, and a shrewd eye on the actions of your opponents.

General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.

You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.<br/>The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.<br/><br/>The calendar mechanics is implemented in the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players (every day a different one) and it could support them, if they catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides the leaders through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands: The B&auml;rfolk, The Emberians, The Islanders and The Cloudborn.<br/>Four factions coexist in the world of Battalia.

Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.<br/><br/>A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.<br/><br/>Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.<br/><br/>Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.<br/><br/>Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-GHaejCSEWT_98OMpQS-Sw__thumb/img/8LjlxqNJ-oVFNvv8pzbtrB27paQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1721040.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-GHaejCSEWT_98OMpQS-Sw__original/img/9uEJbs0de7x_3cTCmJWpuY9sOdA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1721040.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"MegaCon Games","designer":"Brian Shotton, Kenny Sims","artist":"Keith Lowe","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,5],"avgRating":6.57323,"avgWeight":3.8264},{"bggId":149119,"name":"Spirits of the Rice Paddy","description":"Ancient Balinese legend describes a host of powerful spirits who help poor rice farmers achieve success.

With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings.

The first factories were founded by businessmen like Richard Arkwright, who ran the first factory for spinning wool with machines like the &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot; and the water frame.<br/><br/>In &quot;Arkwright: The Card Game&quot;, you run a business and will employ workers in your different factories to produce and sell goods. The more workers, the more goods that can be sold &mdash; but be prepared for crises and some stiff competition.<br/><br/>The game is played over three decades (1770/1780/1790), split up into four rounds per decade. On your turn, you play new cards from your hand to open factories and upgrade existing ones, select improvements, improve factory quality, build machines, and employ new workers. You can also pay money to improve your shareholdings, and take out loans if you require more money for production costs. After the actions phase, you can improve your abilities by advancing your development markers on your player board, or take one of the available development cards.<br/><br/>Then, the production phase starts, where every player who owns a factory of the current good produces those goods. The market fluctuates with the general demand, so the demand may be lower than the value of your current good, lowering your profit. Workers must be paid, and machines need regular maintenance, so you can possibly lose money instead of turning a profit. Selling enough of one good improves your share value, and there are bonuses for having the highest appeal. Lastly, if you can&rsquo;t sell your goods to the home market, you can ship them overseas or store them for future rounds.<br/><br/>After the final round of the last decade, the game ends.

The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering &quot;mythic&quot; feel to it rather than a &ldquo;fantasy adventure&rdquo; sensation.<br/><br/>Glorantha: The Gods War is based on the vigorous mythic realm of Glorantha, which has been the basis for multiple tabletop board, roleplaying, and even digital games, as well as numerous works of fiction. Its depth and scope has been recognized by numerous aficionados of fantasy and gaming, and now it is brought to you in all its astounding power.<br/><br/>In each round, in the Action Phase players spend the power they have earned from various sources, most importantly how many different types of buildings they have and the Heroquests they have achieved. They then spend power to build more buildings, summon and move units, do battle with enemy empires, and use powerful empire-specific abilities including from their earned gifts. The Council Phase may include an attempt to close the Chaos Rift that threatens the existence of the world and/or the Great Compromise in which an empire may sacrifice power for the greater good and to distribute victory points.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by obtaining victory points from various sources, most importantly the number of buildings controlled each round, paired Heroquests achieved and the Great Compromise, and from runes.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HMT9UXpcv3rA7TOVW9390w__thumb/img/dov-SelIV6KDNdWF_T2KksyIEuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4211206.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HMT9UXpcv3rA7TOVW9390w__original/img/mvdLYJBQA9W8gjf302EEvQwEPz8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4211206.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Petersen Games","designer":"Sandy Petersen","artist":"Rich Fleider","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,null],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":7.9332,"avgWeight":3.4091},{"bggId":215437,"name":"Codex: Card-Time Strategy – Core Set","description":"Codex: Card-Time Strategy is a customizable, non-collectable card game set in the Fantasy Strike universe that's inspired by real-time strategy video games such as Starcraft and Warcraft 3.

Unused dice can be converted into stockpile markers for future use. By purchasing improvements, players can gain more dice with special abilities, become more efficient at laying rail or stockpiling dice, or increase the points they receive when other players deliver cargo over their rails. Bonus points are awarded for delivering passengers quickly or delivering freight over long distances.<br/><br/>The large, two-sided, colorful board has two maps. The western U.S. map, from the California gold rush era, is designed for 2 &ndash; 4 players. With many double-track routes, this map allows newer players to effectively plan their networks and maximize deliveries. The southeastern U.S. map, depicting the late Nineteenth Century, has only single-track routes that are significantly interwoven. This provides more advanced strategic options and is intended for 3 &ndash; 5 experienced players.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4PpJtnuz686Vf6SmWqPwdg__thumb/img/NkGGmLorKgiBkYvnaxdJNF7Y80w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1289852.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4PpJtnuz686Vf6SmWqPwdg__original/img/oXKcYxOJGH3SAc4u8-fCPiRs9ss=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1289852.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"APE Games","designer":"Kevin G.

In Canterbury, 2 to 4 players represent Saxon Lords who are charged with building the city into a prosperous capital. The Saxon Lords must use the city's meager starting resources to build up the 25 districts of Canterbury and provide key services to its citizens.<br/><br/>The key services are (in order from most basic to most prestigious) water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture. These services are provided by structures that are built in the various districts. However, structures that provide higher end services can only be built if the more basic services are already present in that district. For example, a Saxon Lord cannot order the construction of a chapel (which provides religion) unless there is already water and food in that district.<br/><br/>As new structures are built in the city, the city grows more prosperous. While each Saxon Lord jealously guards his or her own prosperity and achievements, they all benefit as a whole from the growing prosperity of the city itself. The city treasury grows as the city prospers, and the Saxon Lords must balance their publicly scrutinized withdrawals from the treasury with the ambition of their building projects. When the city reaches the peak of its prosperity, the game ends and the player with the most individual prosperity wins the game.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>Every structure that is built in Canterbury provides Prosperity Points both to the city and to the Saxon Lord who ordained its construction.

Over the following centuries, Europe was taken over. In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H&auml;ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.<br/><br/>Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.<br/><br/>In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wTXpY-pvsltCVEZ-wVir2g__thumb/img/B8qrSrIfS2Qs0vhkvzC-nAjKbJM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic575855.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wTXpY-pvsltCVEZ-wVir2g__original/img/uYpf9LloFDuqyS0h5lOljOCtdzg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic575855.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"The Game Master BV","designer":"Hans van Tol","artist":"Volkan Baga, Arenea Kunkeler","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.59129,"avgWeight":3.2348},{"bggId":32014,"name":"Confucius","description":"In the Celestial Empire of the Ming Dynasty the leading families vie with one another for political power and influence over the Imperial government.

Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.<br/><br/>The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies.

Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.<br/><br/>There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.<br/><br/>1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.<br/><br/>Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.

Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1OYql8M2vWNy_p6leIsV9w__thumb/img/IONl_v4rDRne9w8j5MrlELLmrvU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1220000.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1OYql8M2vWNy_p6leIsV9w__original/img/KQow3sBvo9B2vvW9V5JbYgtqyjk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1220000.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":1994,"publisher":"Chris Lawson","designer":"Manlio Manzini, Federico Vellani","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4,6],"avgRating":8.0348,"avgWeight":4.4103},{"bggId":234521,"name":"Necromunda: Underhive","description":"Get ready for a new generation of war in the underhive.

These cards modify actions as they happen such as adding dice to attacks or making more tactical movement. The hero cards can also be used to take additional actions beyond your base actions.<br/><br/>Each hero also comes with exciting Feats which can be used to turn the tide or secure that crucial objective right when you need to. On top of that, each hero receives a number of &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; can be spent to automatically succeed at tests such as attacks. In desperate moments you can also use &ldquo;Heroics&rdquo; to prevent failed tests, but this will find you running out of them fast!<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the players will find items that they can carry and use. Some of these will be things they are looking for as part of their missions. Other things will be useful stuff like medical supplies, vril healing potions, guns, grenades, etc.<br/><br/>Custom dice will be used to decide the outcome of attacks, defence and the impacts of noise created by players. Each card tells you how much noise it creates, and how much Nazi activity it triggers. The more cards you play, the more noise you generate, and the more the Nazis act in response.<br/><br/>The Nazi reinforcements will be relentless so the heroes need to complete their objective and escape before time runs out and they get overwhelmed by the Nazi forces and their vril tech.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8u1aHWfQzE57na8wsshZ1A__thumb/img/fpuGx1BkRa0jdog-cf4khMeBSVE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4511709.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8u1aHWfQzE57na8wsshZ1A__original/img/ikkrUtlCqS5IFDy7clURNHbwNpY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4511709.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Mythic Games","designer":"Jake Thornton","artist":"Aurelie Bouquet, Stéphane Gantiez, Catalin Lartist, Christophe Madura, Guillem H.

The empty barges were drawn upstream by horses afterwards.<br/><br/>However, the Ruhr was not generally navigable in this time. Large dams at mills and low dams for fishing were common. At these spots the coal had to be transferred from one barge to the next. This decreased the quality of the coal considerably &ndash; sometimes only &quot;coal dust&quot; reached Ruhrort. Only the building of 14 locks between Witten and Ruhrort changed this.<br/><br/>The Ruhr remained an important route for coal until the end of the 19th century.

In 2015, he released 1867: Railways of Canada, which is a standalone game that uses 1861's core rules on a different map with a handful of variations to gameplay. Both are classic examples of the versatile 18xx system of train games. They are straightforward enough to be your 1st 18xx game while still offering the depth you want in your 100th game.<br/><br/>1861 and 1867 are perfect as weeknight games as they can usually be played by experienced players in 3 hours. The games are staples at 18xx gaming conventions often as a palate cleanser after playing a longer title. What makes 1861/1867 in particular great entry points into the 18xx system is that the two games introduce the different game mechanics in phases. The beginning of a game only has Minor Companies running relatively simple operations and as the game progresses, new mechanisms like Merger Rounds and the National Railway are introduced.

But beware: as the city grows, everything you build will also open up new opportunities for your competitors. Will you make a fortune? Or will you be caught out when the boom inevitably turns to bust in a game-ending market crash?&rdquo;<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Magnate: The First City is a midweight strategy game for 1-5 players. Each turn players try to grow their property empire by performing different actions, including: buying plots of land, constructing buildings, marketing their developments and selling them completely for their capital value. Once per round, they will also get the chance to attract tenants to any empty buildings they have. If they are successful, they will start collecting rent from their tenants and increase the value of their holdings. At the same time, they will also create new development opportunities for themselves and their opponents.<br/><br/>But in Magnate, as in real life, not all locations are equally appealing to all types of tenant. Magnate&rsquo;s four types of tenant - residential, offices, retail and industry - all want to be linked to other types of tenant in nearby neighbourhoods. And they are all affected differently by what&rsquo;s next door: The airport is an asset for offices, but it&rsquo;s an unattractive place for new residents. By clever tactical and strategic building, players can increase their odds of attracting these tenants and improve their return on investment - without benefiting their opponents too much.<br/><br/>But while the players acquire more and larger properties, the price of land keeps rising higher and higher. Eventually, it becomes completely unsustainable and a game-ending crash that will destroy the value of players&rsquo; properties becomes inevitable. When exactly the crash happens, however, is shaped by the players: How much land they buy and how much property they sell will more make a crash on any specific turn more or less likely. Players must time their actions carefully to avoid substantial losses while maximizing their profits. Only then will they emerge victorious as the city&rsquo;s wealthiest property magnate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mkiI85CzDVnOHMwz57k1vA__thumb/img/I9R2nShbXb3EPuw0lEnLptMhsSk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6725286.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mkiI85CzDVnOHMwz57k1vA__original/img/PGy8FX6kGuKtBPcs5m4D4BdnpdI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6725286.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Naylor Games","designer":"James Naylor","artist":"Donal Hegarty, Cze Lee, James Naylor","honors":"2021 Cardboard Republic Tactician Laurel Nominee","bestPlayers":[],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,4,5],"avgRating":7.70412,"avgWeight":3.2105},{"bggId":32838,"name":"The Battle for Normandy","description":"From the GMT Website:<br/><br/>The Battle for Normandy is a game that represents the climactic campaign in Normandy from D-Day, 6 June 1944 to the first week of August 1944 at primarily battalion level.

During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.<br/><br/>Space Race is a card game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.<br/><br/>The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.<br/><br/>Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QIdP1qlQYW-FrBogxhyqYw__thumb/img/pA-VBHZpaKp284zImOLrt7b3SxA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3545293.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QIdP1qlQYW-FrBogxhyqYw__original/img/wjqGzpKGV5DfLqCSDglH_5rkgQc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3545293.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"(Web published)","designer":"Marek Loskot, Jan Soukal","artist":"Zak Eidsvoog, Dalibor Krch","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1],"avgRating":6.87852,"avgWeight":3.0476},{"bggId":299566,"name":"Batman: The Animated Series Adventures – Shadow of the Bat","description":"Running off IDW Games' miniatures-driven &quot;Adventures Universal Game System&quot; (AUGS) engine, Batman: The Animated Series Adventures &ndash; Shadow of the Bat allows players to take the role of any hero in their roster in the game's 24 unique missions, which  areall inspired by fan-favorite episodes.

They grew up to be gods and guardians of the biosphere. The siblings loved each other very much. They were strong of build and sharp of mind. Whatever they attempted, they succeeded with ease, and faultlessly. When the young gods had grown to adulthood, Artaois and Branwen bade them each create something to add it to their creation, so that it would enrich the world and populate it. And thus, the gods created six very different types.<br/><br/>Time passed and the creations of the gods multiplied and spread without restraint across the biosphere. And so it came to pass that Artaios and Branwen bade their children bring order to their creation. Whoever would be the first to bring their population into accord with the biological order would be called &quot;Lord of Creation&quot; from thereon.<br/><br/>In Biosphere, the player siblings each control groups of different populations (dubbed &quot;types&quot; in game terms). In each round, a percentage of the types goes extinct, then players receive and spend evolutionary points to make their types either larger or smaller, and more versatile or more dedicated depending on what they think is appropriate for the landscape (which is scaled based on the number of players) and the current state of the game. Reproduction, movement, and lifespan can all be modified by players during the game. If a player meets the right conditions, they can play one development card from hand, gaining benefits from this. Players then move across the landscape, reproduce, and fill the different terrains based on their positions relative to other players.<br/><br/>How do the siblings prove their worth to Artaios and Branwen? By fulfilling assignments revealed at the start of play. One assignment is drawn from each of seven categories, and once a player completes an assignment, they mark it, with others still being able to mark it later.

He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.<br/><br/>Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.<br/><br/>At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.<br/><br/>The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.<br/><br/>A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.<br/><br/>If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? <br/>The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead.

For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.<br/><br/>Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!<br/><br/>The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.<br/><br/>Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned.

Players compete to make their fortune by concentrating or diversifying in the various aspects of the industry such as mining, refining, and shipping. Whoever ends the game with the most money wins.<br/><br/>The game is played over four rounds, but it might end early due to health and safety regulations that shut down the industry by eliminating all areas in which they can act. In each round, players begin their turns by selecting a country in which to execute their actions. This selection triggers an event within it, in addition to having an effect on its economy.<br/><br/>Players then use a unique system to draft three actions at once for the round. These actions can be a mix of building mines, building refineries, gaining government subsidies, establishing railroads, and establishing ports. Once all players have executed their actions, they may convert their money (i.e., victory points) into specific country resources, with each country having its own conversion rate.<br/><br/>A player's industry then goes into motion with mines producing raw asbestos, refineries refining that asbestos, and railroads and ports transporting these goods around the world. Players may also have a chance to invest in their own companies to gain an edge. When players mine or refine asbestos, they must choose to either maximize profits for short-term gains or sacrifice their hard-won money to minimize deaths, thus sustaining the industry.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z2GUs8PFf9gaqXC68GN_NQ__thumb/img/YABZ_jJLNqNIoaKxtfGNs3agysc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375828.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z2GUs8PFf9gaqXC68GN_NQ__original/img/Jt1voc7AAma7uyZGid6jfKnwhsc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375828.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Spielworxx","designer":"Armando Canales","artist":"Harald Lieske","honors":"2021 Goblin Magnifico Nominee","bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.18613,"avgWeight":3.5517},{"bggId":911,"name":"Empires of the Middle Ages","description":"This classic SPI game from 1980 covers the economic and political landscape of Medieval Europe from 771 to 1467 on an area map.

Ireland was a poor country, but there is no lack of enthusiasm for railways among investors. Up to 13 5-share companies will start in a random sequence. Some of these companies will become successful, others, as a result of underinvestment, isolation or poor timing will struggle to survive. All is not lost for the strugglers, however. A unique shareholder voting mechanism allows companies to merge into 10-share companies(sometimes against their director&rsquo;s wishes) with their more or less successful neighbours.<br/>Track laying provides its own problems as many track tiles are unique. Often, there is no available tile to provide the most efficient route so a roundabout route sometimes must suffice. There are two types of track that can be built: broad gauge and narrow gauge. There are no purchasable narrow gauge locomotives; instead narrow gauge track operates in an abstract way and boosts the value of the broad gauge stations to which it connects.  <br/>Trains in 18Ireland are hex trains. They become obsolete in two stages: rusted trains may be bought back from the bank at half price (but also half capability) and continue to operate until they rot and are then removed. As the game progresses the train rush becomes brutal. Player bankruptcy does not end the game and survivors continue until they have broken a bank that starts with just &pound;4,000.<br/>18Ireland can be played by 3 to 6 players. Experience has shown that at a low player count, this is a &ldquo;run good companies&rdquo; game. At a higher player count, the game is more combative as share portfolios are more diverse and the hostile merger becomes a bigger factor in the game.

Designed by a real-life space engineer with a PhD in long-duration spaceflight from MIT, Stellar Horizons is intended to be a plausible representation of the first steps of humanity towards the stars between 2030 and 2169, with each turn representing a year of time. You control your faction's space program, outposts, and fleets spanning across the solar system, although you also have some influence over your faction's politics back home on Earth as space development becomes more important.<br/><br/>Movement is based on real physics. You move from orbit to orbit, or conduct long range transfers to move between planetary systems like Earth, Mars, or Jupiter. As you send out robotic explorers and crewed vehicles to explore the solar system, they bring back valuable data to further your scientific research. Technologies are intended to represent plausible extrapolations of existing development during the next 150 years: there are no transporters or warp drive, but you will be able to develop rockets powered by fusion and even anti-matter. In the engineering and biology domains, you'll eventually be able to construct space elevators and put your crews into safe hibernation for long journeys.<br/><br/>You'll have access to a wide variety of robot explorers and crewed ships. These range from tiny probes intended to merely take photographs as you fly past Jupiter, to giant destroyers, cruisers, and battleships which ply the space lanes with peaceful or hostile intentions. New ship types become available as you gain access to better technology over the course of the game.<br/><br/>You'll be given a budget to spend on Earth and can also build bases to harvest minerals, organics, and fuel to expands your economy. You can also forge diplomatic relationships with players and non-player factions alike, and trade resources at their bases to earn extra cash. Each of the seven factions has different strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and available ships based on their unique geopolitical situation. Military conflict is certainly possible but not always encouraged. Stellar Horizons features more diplomatic, technological, and economic competition than outright combat, although neglecting warships entirely leaves you vulnerable to pirates, trade embargoes, and sneak attacks by rogue players and factions.<br/><br/>Stellar Horizons includes short co-operative and competitive scenarios lasting an hour or more, and campaigns lasting a day up to about a full weekend for experienced players. Up to seven players can play at a time and the game is most fun with at least two, but there are also one-player scenarios, and the campaigns are highly suited for solo play.

Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances.

You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!<br/><br/>Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord.

You will also be attentive to the well-being of patients and not forget that time is also money when competing with neighboring hospitals...<br/><br/>Each turn in Clinic, players take three actions &mdash; building in different modules; hosting patients; hiring doctors, nurses and staff &mdash; by playing one card. Each cube that enters the clinic comes with a car that needs to be parked, leaving less space for the hospital being constructed! During the game, you'll move patients, doctors, nurses, and staff in the 3D structure as efficiently as you can in order to save time, with doctors and nurses tending to patients as long as their colors (indicating both training and illness) match. By taking care of patients you receive money, which lets you pay fees, salaries and maintenance as well as buy popularity points.<br/><br/>During an administrative phase, uncared for patients grow sicker, new patients enter the pre-admission room, doctors become less knowledgable about the diseases they face, and new doctors and nurses become available from their schools. In the end, the player with the most popularity points and least time spent during the game wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0h4tT_KNHsXjuWHIqf7mQw__thumb/img/SKI7vJCUmYXqU8CPrmIzC5NhS1o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2212910.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0h4tT_KNHsXjuWHIqf7mQw__original/img/aJr5PH_ufpviRKa_7wUViQRrz5k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2212910.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"(Self-Published)","designer":"Alban Viard","artist":"Da-Fanny, Sampo Sikiö","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.09377,"avgWeight":4.0789},{"bggId":816,"name":"2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt","description":"2038 is a space mining adaptation of the 18xx series of games.

It has touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans. It has come to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants. That chaos grew greater when the Moon revealed itself to be a &quot;kami&quot; (a Japanese God of old) - the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves of their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.<br/><br/>TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame that demands specific strategic skills of its players. Its particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Values and abilities of the factions still don&rsquo;t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: it&rsquo;s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players&rsquo; weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life.<br/><br/>FACTIONS<br/>THE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.<br/><br/>THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species - claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.<br/><br/>THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.<br/><br/>THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win.<br/>After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.<br/><br/>According to the descending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their &quot;Homezones&quot;, pick three start-areas and place their units.<br/>Prior to the first round, they also choose a white action card - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red action cards. Every phase is represented by six of those action cards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.<br/><br/>Each round consists of the following phases:<br/>White Phase: Players use the white action card they chose to emphasize their strategy.<br/>Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.<br/>Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.<br/>Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.<br/><br/>END<br/>The game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds<br/><br/>MICROBADGES<br/> Tsukuyumi fan - logo<br/> Tsukuyumi fan - moon<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hnce1jWgrTJ3iIhCG9OGow__thumb/img/vxH1KAsDi_B8bNYFqw4dDLMkoXQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5259202.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hnce1jWgrTJ3iIhCG9OGow__original/img/HKNa0ZuCUP_tj8IXhXNvuMcRtGc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5259202.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Grey Fox Games","designer":"Felix Mertikat","artist":"Felix Mertikat","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,null],"avgRating":7.54402,"avgWeight":3.6667},{"bggId":217576,"name":"Hellenica: Story of Greece","description":"An explosion of creativity and violence erupted in the Aegean Basin in 800 B.C. that defined ancient Greece.

From its rise in the ninth century to its decline and fall in the eighteenth, players take part in the golden age that built the city that once was the Queen of the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>Each player controls a patrician household, vying for power against other influential families. To gain clout and fortune (i.e., victory points), families extend their Influence outside the city, sending representatives to foreign markets. As their authority spreads, the power of Venice increases accordingly, and distant towns and ports fall under the sway of the Serenissima. In the meantime, players compete inside the city for the coveted title of Doge, the head of the government, spending resources and Ducati (money) to gain popularity.<br/><br/>But the hegemony of Venice over the Mediterranean is threatened by many enemies. The Republic faces the rise of competing powers, such as the rival seafaring Republic of Genoa and the Crown of Aragon to the west, or the Eastern Roman Empire and then the Turks to the east. Century after century, players will take part in the struggle that will see the rise and fall of the Republic of Venice.<br/><br/>Venetia is played across three epochs: Rise, Apogee and Struggle. A Power track on the board is used to record the passage of time. Venice starts the game in its Rise, and the game ends when the Struggle epoch is completed.

It is driven by macabre stories of a world gone mad and features adventure, politics and economics to deliver an unlimited sandbox experience. Each game the variables change: cards, player interactions, stories, strategies and threats. While the game has a strong pulp influence, its roots stem from Cold War studies. We have expanded upon this research to arrive at our game&rsquo;s premise: What would happen after a nuclear and biological apocalypse?<br/><br/>Our answer is Fallen Land. As a player, you are the leader of a unique faction of survivors competing for primacy in the ruinous aftermath of post-apocalyptic America. You must manage and enhance your town, protect your citizens and secure resources. You will also have to make and break treaties to endure, amidst a myriad of bribery and betrayal by the other players. But that is just where the adventure begins! You must also direct your agents (a party of characters), to explore the rugged landscape, establish your territory and solidify your agenda.<br/><br/>Game play is comprised of Turns. Each represents one month and is divided into Phases and Sub-Phases. The First Player resolves each Phase and Sub-Phase followed clockwise by the other players, before proceeding to the next Phase or Sub-Phase. A Turn is over when all players have had the opportunity to act or pass on each Phase.<br/><br/>I. Effects Phase *<br/>    1.) Resolve.<br/><br/>II. Town Business Phase *<br/>    1.) Deal.<br/>    2.) Resource Production.<br/>    3.) Auction House.<br/>    4.) Roll 1d10 on Town Events Chart.<br/>    5.) Financial period.<br/>        ~Sell.<br/>        ~Purchase.<br/>        ~Hire (NPCMs).<br/><br/>III. Party Exploits Phase *<br/>    1.) NPCMs move.<br/>    2.) Choose Party Exploits (4 weeks to spend).    <br/>        ~Movement, spend 1 week.<br/>        ~Encounter, spend 1 week.<br/>        ~PVP, spend 1 week.<br/>        ~Resource, spend 2 weeks.<br/>        ~Healing, spend 2 weeks.<br/>        ~Mission, spend 3 weeks.<br/><br/>IV. End Turn Phase *<br/>    1.) Adjust Turn Marker.<br/>    2.) Pass the First Player Sheet.<br/><br/><br/>    Resolve an Action Card in each Phase or Sub-Phase as directed by the card.<br/><br/><br/>A player's town is simulated by a Town Play Mat. Players organize their owned Resources, inventory, Party Characters, excess Characters and movement bonuses here. In addition, Town Play Mats can be upgraded three different ways: Town Defense Chips, Town Technologies and Action Cards. The first two upgrades are available for purchase during the Town Business Phase. However, Action Cards are dealt at the beginning of each Turn and are also drawn as a reward.<br/><br/>    Players also manage their Party consisting of five Character Cards. Characters may be equipped with gear (Spoils Cards), to increase their Base Skills. A party can move around the map, draw Encounter and Mission cards (stories) which contain Skill Checks (challenges) and even attack another player's Party in PVP. Dice are rolled for these many &quot;deeds&quot; to determine the outcome. <br/> There are seven decks of cards. These are drawn and played throughout the game. Some are stories, such as Encounter and Mission Cards, Characters are a Faction's agents, and Spoils are equipment/vehicle/gear. Lastly, Action Cards modify the story and/or game play.<br/><br/>To win, one of two Victory Conditions is necessary, either 20 Prestige or 80 Town Health. Prestige represents your reputation as a leader, while Town Health represents your town&rsquo;s prosperity and number of its citizens. Both conditions are marked on their respective Victory Tracks bordering the map.<br/><br/>Adventure and intrigue await!  We hope you have the opportunity to play Fallen Land and that you enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed creating it for you.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xQMSWwsI8lBFF64th7F1Fg__thumb/img/oz6gKwr5sFR0nMyNENYsg2TqBYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4280565.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xQMSWwsI8lBFF64th7F1Fg__original/img/i3I2EVbgt1vIelOa39LmUiYaojs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4280565.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Fallen Dominion Studios, LLC","designer":"Sean Cahill, Jon Lonngren","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3],"avgRating":8.1724,"avgWeight":3.6765},{"bggId":201455,"name":"Assault of the Giants","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Based on the story first presented in the Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder adventure from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Assault of the Giants is a new board game designed by Andrew Parks for 3-6 players.

Order your giants to assault small folk villages and cities to score points and secure resources including food, artifacts, ore, and runes.<br/><br/>Each player issues commands to their giants in the form of command cards (recruit, move, attack, pillage, and so on). This allows players to recruit new giants, send them out to attack settlements and other giants, and also to pursue special agendas based upon their race. Each player represents a different giant race (hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, or storm giants), each with a different agenda.  For example, the Storm Giants seek to restore their lost monarch, King Hekaton. The Cloud Giants seek an ancient dragon treasure trove, and the Hill Giants seek an abundance of food with which to feed their massive monarch, Chief Guh.<br/><br/>Contents include 12 Giants miniatures, injection molded in color, measuring from approximately 60mm to over 90mm in height, and three Giantslayers.<br/><br/>Preliminary FAQ: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-preliminary-faq\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-prel...</a><br/><br/>Official Variants: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26201496\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26201496</a><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3Pxy3JTDnJpJcOQsW-ztuw__thumb/img/DOK3PvtR14b0uprvUh0tTp3dYCU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3048557.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3Pxy3JTDnJpJcOQsW-ztuw__original/img/NqVocINA9Jjtf9cCUmXMWSJToFY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3048557.png","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"WizKids (I)","designer":"Andrew Parks","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.72251,"avgWeight":3.4231},{"bggId":265635,"name":"Space Race","description":"The world struggles in the Cold War, and many see the sky as the next battlefield. The era of Space Race has just begun. Do you have what it takes to lead a daring space agency into a new age of human achievement?<br/><br/>Space Race takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.<br/><br/>Space Race: The Board Game is a game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.<br/><br/>The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.<br/><br/>Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q41h7Zq8gu_7Y87X9HC94Q__thumb/img/aPrE3SXaJplbj9OZ3t0CmjORI3s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5629926.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q41h7Zq8gu_7Y87X9HC94Q__original/img/_8k-fmQeM7-LMRlKfHvaIG5qD04=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5629926.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Boardcubator","designer":"Michal Mikeš, Martin Řehořík, Jan Soukal","artist":"Dalibor Krch, Radoslav Javor, Marek Loskot, Michael Petrus, Pavel Richter, Michal Rumlena","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":7.2165,"avgWeight":3.2},{"bggId":32002,"name":"Forged in Steel","description":"In the multiplayer card-driven, city-building strategy game Forged in Steel, players take on the role of a prominent family in a burgeoning Colorado county in 1900 as turbulent social and technological changes are about to reshape the way all Americans live. Each family seeks to control one of four sectors (mining, industry, city, or commercial) while also striving to be Mayor to control the appointment of other players to offices.<br/><br/>The game takes place over three eras (turns/decades), each with multiple phases in which players are dealt eight cards &mdash; all with historic black-and-white photos from Colorado &mdash; and must discard one and bank two for their final turn. Cards are used to either play Municipal Muscle points to build, buy, or seize structures, or used for the &quot;event&quot; listed on every card. Cards can also be used to set yearly &quot;Headlines&quot; or &quot;Themes&quot; which evoke a movement in American society or technology and change VP awards or other variables in the game. Structures are scored by multiplying the amount the sector tracks have advanced by the number of buildings owned. Different tracks progress differently.<br/><br/>Finally, players can build parks, civic buildings, hospitals, and police stations. These buildings in turn affect further play and cause neighborhoods to have more political votes at turn's end, increase VPs for proximity, or protect against certain negative cards.<br/><br/>Forged in Steel is an organic building game in that all builds change the landscape and players may build only adjacent to where others have built &quot;the grid/network&quot;. At turn's end, the game decides how many immigrants come seeking jobs based on how many factories and commercial buildings were built that turn. Too many? Unrest grows and there could be a riot, undermining all of your recent city-building efforts. The National Guard will step in to help you, of course, but they are usually outnumbered, and there's often fighting in the streets, so be wary of not contributing to the &quot;Unrest Track&quot;.<br/><br/>Can your family negotiate the turbulent changes of the early 1900s and become the local political and economic powerhouse? From the New Deal, Women's Suffrage, City Beautiful and Spanish Flu, to sidewalks and paved streets, all aspects of a 1900s western American city are incorporated, and players will learn about the rise of those developments that changed cities, labor, industry, and society forever.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPienXFWIHoCy5snZcBZ2g__thumb/img/aC00_L47Wf5N_TS4L8m0XlC3low=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2813061.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPienXFWIHoCy5snZcBZ2g__original/img/OvPMVwmO3HFwhpvbtEBMAKELTl4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2813061.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Knight Works, LLC","designer":"Wade Broadhead","artist":"Jamie Noble-Frier","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.28103,"avgWeight":3.5294},{"bggId":280726,"name":"Legacies","description":"You are famous - one of the most well-known names of the early 19th Century.

The ambitious Caesar, a military ingenue, had little idea of how lucky he was going to be -- as he was in usually everything he did -- because, within a short space of a few years, after coming to the rescue of the Gauls against incursions from Germanic tribes to the east, Caesar himself decided to bring the rest of the barbarian tribes under the domain of Republican Rome...and, at the same time, increase his visibility among the Roman people.<br/>From a military point of view it was an immense achievement, one that fueled Roman imperialist feelings like no other war. For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.<br/><br/>Bibracte 58BC     <br/>Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.<br/><br/>The Rhine 58BC     <br/>Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.<br/><br/>The Sabis 57BC     <br/>Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.<br/><br/>Bay of Biscay 56BC     <br/>The sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.<br/><br/>Britannia 55BC     <br/>Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.<br/><br/>Lutetia 52BC     <br/>There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.<br/>        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.<br/>        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.<br/>        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.<br/>        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.<br/>        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.<br/>        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.<br/>        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four<br/><br/>(source: GMT website)<br/><br/><br/>Expansion Modules:<br/><br/>     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia<br/>     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE<br/>     Battles of the Warrior Queen: Covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero.

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.<br/><br/>Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.<br/>There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.<br/><br/>The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.<br/><br/>Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)<br/>    over 2500 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)<br/>    a complete set of rules<br/>    a complete set of charts<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/>(source: back of the box and user's description)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/60YrvRsC8IcCD2hHibCmgQ__thumb/img/C1q1ad-28jRhsitwd703qQjAThg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic43415.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/60YrvRsC8IcCD2hHibCmgQ__original/img/of5rXQQs9A-PQF5xpz_oakPk13Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic43415.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1984,"publisher":"Game Designers' Workshop","designer":"John Astell, Rich Banner, Frank Chadwick","artist":"Rich Banner, Rodger B.

There are many ways to lose, but only a handful paths to victory.<br/><br/>During Battles, 1 to 4 players must cooperate to defeat 1 giant Primordial boss-type monster controlled by a sophisticated AI system.

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don &ndash; entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced.

With roots tracing back to the classic Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.<br/><br/><br/>A World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9gjjgu37WqNSUd3sZsb-g__thumb/img/Af_3T6nTfTa0aN4DQZzCZzpu04w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic34304.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9gjjgu37WqNSUd3sZsb-g__original/img/KwPRlDFi7W4QAWvH7aObcCho3tM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic34304.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2003,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Bruce Harper","artist":"Rodger B.

This period is often considered to feature the birth of Western Warfare, as opposed to the Persian/Eastern style, which relied on archery , light cavalry, and mobility.<br/><br/>Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories (well, our theories, using your dice) with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.<br/><br/>Hoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat (the Run Don&rsquo;t Walk rules) and a whole lot more.  We even still have some good old chariots!<br/>  <br/>And you get to fight what was the biggest land battle in European history up until Napoleonic times, the immense Battle of Plataea (truly the deciding engagement of the Greco-Persian Wars):  two maps and about 250 combat  counters covering The Greek Contingents from 26 City-States under Pausanias, Spartan Regent and General, vs. The Persians, Medes, Asians (Bactrians, Scythians, Indians and a whole lot of others) and seven Medized Greek city-states, under Mardonius, Persian Commander and son-in-law of The Great King, Darius I.<br/> The package includes Simple GBoH versions for each of the battles along with special rules that highlight the hoplite style of warfare.<br/><br/>Hoplite is the ultimate board game simulation on the birth of Western Warfare.

And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.<br/><br/>The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...<br/><br/>Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.<br/><br/>When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.<br/><br/>Each turn is formed of two phases:<br/><br/><br/>     The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents. <br/>     Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action. <br/>         Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.<br/>         Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.<br/>         Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).<br/>         Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area. <br/>         Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCEROEH7sFwvrjTwU16c7g__thumb/img/6vMnEdH24f8kjNUDyG74IsSaPWg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3537131.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCEROEH7sFwvrjTwU16c7g__original/img/l0ZEXkZz9COm83PtS1Woq1_bmfo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3537131.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Starling Games (II)","designer":"Tim Heerema","artist":"Enggar Adirasa, Dann May","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":6.67336,"avgWeight":3.25},{"bggId":238889,"name":"Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog","description":"'In the lands of the North, where the Black Rocks stand guard against the cold sea, in the dark night that is very long the Men of the Northlands sit by their great log fires and they tell a tale...

From approximately 1700 BC to 1200 BC (which was the abrupt end of the Bronze Age) the chariot reigned supreme on the battlefield. It was the first modern weapons system, and chariots controlled most of warfare until actual cavalry appeared in the middle of the Iron Age.<br/>  <br/>But how did chariots work as a tactical weapons system? There is no complete historical agreement on what exactly they did or how they were used, but Chariots of Fire will show you our view of their many applications - and many types of chariotry there were - providing GBoH players with the complete and definitive chariot rules.

Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.<br/><br/>The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.<br/><br/>As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.<br/><br/>Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.<br/><br/>Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules.

You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete World War II squad-level combat missions.<br/><br/>The core game gives you a full team of US Marines and a full set of Japanese Hostiles. Each Expansion then adds to these sets. This includes the soldiers, weapons, equipment, and tactics used by each of those nations. Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!<br/><br/>At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range to the target, running out of ammo, suppression fire, and cover - all in the same dice roll! This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack. As you eliminate soldiers, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards, play Support cards, and activate special Skills.<br/><br/>The contents of this set includes:<br/><br/><br/>     280 cards comprising:<br/>         6 USMC Player Soldiers / 6 Non-Player Soldiers / 5 Squad Soldiers<br/>         9 Missions / 15 Objectives / 18 Locations<br/>         15 Weapons / 6 Gear<br/>         29 Skills<br/>         95 Action / 17 Location Markers<br/>         50 Japanese Hostiles / 9 Events<br/>    <br/>     5 counter sheets with 430 counters<br/>     d6 and d10 dice<br/>     Mounted display board<br/>     9 Campaign sheets<br/>     Warfighter Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>The initial print-run from the Kickstarter also included 65 customized Soldier cards as part of KS pledge levels, in addition to 27 errata cards for Warfighter WWII Europe and 16 extra WWII Pacific cards.<br/><br/>Soldier Types<br/>There are 3 levels of Soldiers in Warfighter: Player Soldiers, Non-Player Soldiers, and Squad Soldiers. If you think about it from a movie point of view...<br/><br/>Player Soldiers are the stars of the movie. You get to see all their details and really get to know them. They get Health, a hand of Action cards, Skills, detailed Weapon cards. These are the guys you know up-close and personal.<br/><br/>Non-Player Soldiers have a cost and you purchase them at the start of a Mission as you would a Player Soldier. The NPSs don't hold a hand of Action cards. They have Weapons, Equipment, and Skills, and you use them as normal. They also have a number of Actions per turn based on their current Health. Instead of relying on Action cards for defense, they use the same Cover rules as the Hostiles.<br/><br/>This makes them much easier to run, and allows you to easily expand your squad.<br/><br/>Squad Soldiers are the guys standing in the background.<br/><br/>Their soldier cards include all their game info. They do not use other cards or Action cards. These Soldiers make it very easy to command an entire squad with a single player.

This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>     Three 22 x 34 inch maps<br/>     One 24 x 34 inch map<br/>     1120 counters<br/>     Series rule book plus a scenarios book<br/>     Various player aid cards for charts and tables<br/>     Set up cards for each scenario<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.<br/><br/>Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.<br/><br/>Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/><br/>     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.<br/>     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.<br/>     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?<br/>     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.<br/>     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?<br/>     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?<br/>     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario. <br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pE6OL_PasiltqUisDnub-w__thumb/img/m5Ma-pZ7MJNgRY1WQLkm94404Sw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1156752.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pE6OL_PasiltqUisDnub-w__original/img/MZ8CZ31LxgkdI496MguisQ_NqKw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1156752.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Tony Curtis, Vance von Borries","artist":"Todd Davis, Rodger B.

Will you be able to outperform the other homesteaders?<br/><br/>Each player in Nevada City starts the game with a nuclear family &mdash; mother, father, daughter, and son &mdash; and a homestead mat where you can establish farms, fence in livestock, and develop silver mines. You start the game with one mine, one farm, and one ranch, along with some money and an assortment of commodities. The town consists of a few buildings, and other buildings will become available for construction as the years advance, with the game lasting four years.<br/><br/>A year lasts a number of turns until all players have used all of their characters and hired workers. On a turn, a player chooses one of their characters and takes actions until all of that character's actions are spent; a character can't take the same action during a turn. A character can buy new property from city hall; mine, farm, or ranch their own property; claim a building; construct a building; use an existing building; reserve a contract that has conditions for improving the city; or work to fulfill that contract. Each character and worker has a different set of skills that can boost the actions they take, such as finding additional silver in a mine or bringing lumber to a construction site.<br/><br/>You earn victory points (VPs) for constructing buildings, in addition to fees from those buildings when other players use them. You earn VPs for completing contracts as well, with those contracts having different values depending on which buildings are in place at the time. Each player receives a private goal card at the start of the game, and all players score points for these goal cards based on how well they do relative to other players, so pay attention to their choices.<br/><br/>Each year, various events pop up, leaving players to suffer drought or reap the benefits of fertile land, among other things. At the end of a year, workers leave unless you marry them into a family, which will require spirits and other resources.<br/><br/>Nevada City also includes advanced rules that add additional buildings and events to the game, a gambling subgame of sorts, a more volatile production market to make life in the West less predictable, and extra sons and daughters. On top of all that, the unhired workers at the end of a year get rowdy and start shooting up the town, so you need to use your gunslinging abilities to bring them to heel and try to avoid getting wounded since you might lose out on a character's abilities in the subsequent year.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LeEToOM6RR_RFbPt1VnPUA__thumb/img/uxe1WoqwH9tS6CstPt0KYzq40qc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4523876.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LeEToOM6RR_RFbPt1VnPUA__original/img/m4lhLOzAsZ2wZAHm5-Xc6v_nvKU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4523876.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"Rio Grande Games","designer":"Alan D.

These engagements involved General Longstreet&rsquo;s attack against Sickles&rsquo; positions, with troops from Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, assisted as well by Anderson&rsquo;s Division of A.P. Hill&rsquo;s Corps.<br/><br/>The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale game that players can complete in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules overhead normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. Unlike traditional chit-pull systems, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>UNITS<br/><br/>All regiments and batteries of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each unit has a Strength Point number, with each point equaling 50 men or 1 artillery piece, and a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience.<br/><br/>SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS<br/><br/>Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a unique four-D6 dice mechanic. All four differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The black and white dice generate an initial result ranging from 11 to 66. The other two dice (red and blue) simultaneously give the players the tangible effect of the initial result and represent physical casualties suffered by the unit (the red die) and the morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire (the blue die).<br/><br/>Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, Maneuver or Rally. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.<br/><br/>Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system is a unique mechanic and generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for the players. It features four different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:<br/><br/>Division Activation Chits. These activate any one Brigade (not yet activated) from the Division listed on the chit. However, further Brigade activations from this Division are dependent on the Division General&rsquo;s Command Rating and a die roll. A successful die roll places the chit back into the cup and thereby the other Brigades of the Division have a chance to activate in the future.  A failed die roll discards the chit for the turn and the remaining Brigades will not be able to activate normally (however, see below). <br/>CIC Chits.  These are a special kind of Activation Chit. The Union player has a Sickles chit and the Confederate player has a Longstreet chit. These chits allow the player to select any one Brigade in the game for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate a Brigade twice in the turn or activate a Brigade from a Division that has lost its Division Activation Chit. <br/>Event Chits.  There are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of each turn, players may select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are also then placed into the cup with the previously pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they chose. Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all the chits have a different Event listed) and a Command Event side. The Unique Event is a tactical event that can be used on the battlefield and each Event has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Examples are Rebel Yell!, Union Logistics, Quick March and Heroic Stand. The Command Event side is used for more strategic options. The Union player may call for reinforcements from the rest of the Army of the Potomac (only the III Corps Divisions are available at start) and the Confederate player can attempt to better coordinate his attack (by increasing his Division General&rsquo;s Command Ratings). <br/>Wild Chits.  These are the two &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; chits. One chit is Fog of War, which can possibly cause units from either side to conduct unexpected attacks or withdrawals, or can cause General officer casualties. The other chit is Fortunes of War which will immediately discard the next chit pulled with no effect &ndash; including that special pre-selected Event chit if it happens to come up!<br/> MAP<br/><br/>The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire south end of the Gettysburg battlefield. Each hex equal 150 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, swamps, buildings, orchards, etc.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>The game will include at least five scenarios:<br/><br/>The Round Tops. A small scenario to introduce people to the games rules.<br/><br/>The Whirlpool. A ten turn scenario about the most contested part of the battlefield. The Wheatfield, Devils Den, Houck's Ridge and the Peach Orchard. 4:20 to 7:20pm<br/><br/>Assault on the Emmitsburg Road.

Since the system contains the remains of a collapsed star it was bound to be rich in heavy elements, ripe for industrialization. It was thus no surprise, that in 2104 this was one of the first extrasolar systems to be colonized. The surprise came 3 years later, when an ancient artefact belonging to a clearly alien civilization was discovered under the settlement. The observatories picked up the unmistakable tachyon radiation of a fleet slowing down from faster-than-light approaching the system - preparing for the worst case scenario, the UN dispatched its entire Armada to relieve the minimal defenses the settlement holds, while their scientists worked hard to decipher the alien communications, and understand their newfound enemy whose name was revealed to be the Aethyn.<br/><br/>Defence of Procyon III is a highly asymmetric game of four players in two teams: one player takes charge of the Alien space navy, one the Alien ground force, while the other team of the Human space navy admiral and the ground forces' commander stands in their way. The space board uses a hex board, while the ground board is a point-to-point network of locations. The game is played over 12 turns, using card driven, low luck mechanisms that quickly unfold into a fast paced game of combat strategy - presented with countless high quality miniatures in a rich, thematic world. The two commanders of a side will have to work together closely to make sure there are no weaknesses for the enemy to exploit, yet their different mechanisms and different theaters will ensure each player is comfortably occupied with their own responsibilities - avoiding the alpha player issue common in team games.<br/><br/>The game also comes with an automated opponent that takes charge of one of the side.

Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek.

There&rsquo;s nowhere left to run, and all that&rsquo;s left is survival. There is no rescue party waiting, no help from kind strangers...in the world of The Walking Dead, there is no sanctuary&hellip;<br/><br/>The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary is a cooperative board game of desperate survival set in the world of the popular AMC television series. Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members&rsquo; interests may be at odds.<br/><br/>No Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group&rsquo;s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group&rsquo;s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.<br/><br/>Each survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor&rsquo;s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group&rsquo;s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!<br/><br/>With its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show&rsquo;s storylines!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mSA3pqfVxYHJGhtBDQbPaw__thumb/img/TWV5Rt2Dw54lB-D5ITBkOdkNIik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3097992.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mSA3pqfVxYHJGhtBDQbPaw__original/img/Ff0ILFN0-ncFypbjFTs8FtaMLQs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3097992.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Cryptozoic Entertainment","designer":"Adam Sadler, Brady Sadler","artist":"Giorgio De Michele","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":6.80114,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":2800,"name":"The Ironclads: A Tactical Level Game of Naval Combat in the American Civil War 1861-1865","description":"(from a Yaquinto ad:)<br/><br/>The IRONCLADS is a tactical level, simultaneous movement, game of ship-to-ship combat in the American Civil War.

However, things aren&rsquo;t so simple; the characters may have something to say about these well-defined plans!<br/><br/>The six railway companies have different strengths and weaknesses. Some start next to many cities. Some start next to tourist cities. Invest in a company with fewer shares and get return on one&rsquo;s investment faster. However, companies with more shares generally grow for longer. But the Engineer, the Mafia, the Bureaucrat, the Inspector, the Banker, the Ghost, the Construction Mech, the Hotelier, and the Venture Capitalist might make this generality less exact. By the way, the CEO of Ride with Cervantes selects his character first in the first round of the game.<br/><br/>The game is set in Spain. The map has 42 cities, fourteen of which are tourist cities.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a double dividend is paid out for all the shares, and the investor with the most money wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NS0v5lfG4oJX75D0Q588Vw__thumb/img/A7fMCsGtWMdVAg1M7zVVB6Ieew8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3142350.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NS0v5lfG4oJX75D0Q588Vw__original/img/q4pIR3BI3pdlHPHuAVZeR_QDqfA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3142350.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Monsoon Publishing","designer":"Tony Chen","artist":"David Cochard","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[3,4,5],"avgRating":6.99212,"avgWeight":3.8261},{"bggId":180205,"name":"Trans-Siberian Railroad","description":"In the late 19th century, the Russian government commissioned a project to build a railroad that would connect Moscow in the west with Vladivostok in the east. You and your fellow players are buying shares of the railroads that will expand across Russia, attempting to enrich yourself along the way and not lose control of railroads to the Tsar!<br/><br/>Trans-Siberian Railroad &mdash; originally one of three titles in Winsome Games' 2015 Essen Set &mdash; shares some similarities with older Winsome titles in which the rail network is already printed on the board and individual railroad companies purchase the links that are printed. Four companies (Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow) are active at the start of the game, with one share of each company auctioned to the players in that order to provide starting capital for those companies. The winner of each auction chooses an unoccupied link from Moscow to another city; each link has a value listed in it, and the railroad's initial income is set to this value.<br/><br/>Once the game begins, on a turn you can:<br/><br/>&bull; Buy stock, specifically one share in one company or one share each in two different companies; the money paid is placed in the railroad's treasury, and when you buy two shares, you must pay an additional $4 to one of the two companies.<br/><br/>&bull; Build links, specifically one link, two links, or one external link (i.e. to a location on Russia's border) &mdash; but only if the railroad is public (i.e., at least two shares have been purchased) and you hold at least as many shares in that railroad as each other player. (If a railroad has had only one share of stock purchased, it is private.) You can build direct links that extend that railroad's existing network or you can jump another railroad's links to extend the network in a more convoluted way. When you build two links, the second link must start from where the first link built that turn ended. The cost to build an internal link is $4, and if you jump another railroad's links, you must pay $2 to that railroad's treasury; the cost to build an external link is $8, plus $4 to each railroad per link you jumped.<br/><br/>When you build a link, the value of that link &mdash; 2-6 &mdash; is added to that railroad's income. Each time a railroad's income marker lands on or passes over a black mark on the income track, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level. Additionally, when you build two links or an external link, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level.<br/><br/>&bull; Pass.<br/><br/>When you buy two shares, build two links, build one external link, or pass, you move the timing token one space on the timing track. When this token reaches the end of the track, each railroad pays dividends to those who hold stock in it, with the railroad's income being divided by the number of shares owned, then rounded up. If Red has $11 income and you own two shares and another player owns one, then you receive $8 and the other player $4.<br/><br/>After paying out dividends (and re-setting the timing token to 0), if any railroad has a stock value of at least $48, then the game enters phase 2, which starts with an auction for a share of the black and white railroads, with the winner of each auction claiming any one non-external link for that railroad that connects to another railroad's network.<br/><br/>In phase 2, once you pay out dividends, you check to see whether any railroad's stock value is equal to or less than the nationalization value, which starts at $24 and which increases after each dividend payout in phase 1, each failure to auction a railroad's share at the start of either phase, and each dividend payout in phase 2 during which no railroads were nationalized. If a railroad's stock value is less than the nationalization value, that railroad is nationalized, with each owner of its stock getting one final dividend payment, after which all shares of that railroad are removed from the game. Once all nationalizations are complete, the nationalization value is increased three levels for each nationalization that took place.<br/><br/>If at this point any railroad has a stock value of $75 or the dividend marker has reached the end of the track, the game ends; otherwise players continue playing. When the game ends, players sum the value of the stocks they hold in public railroads with any money they have on hand. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ciXTuvppLlQnArLZPQu3Tw__thumb/img/FTAkR8wtMH99OicCa-kEX0ecYEM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5343240.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ciXTuvppLlQnArLZPQu3Tw__original/img/SpLa4t_4jyPeC0iJ25Zqse_WG84=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5343240.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Rio Grande Games","designer":"Amabel Holland","artist":"Todd Sanders","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.21232,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":297674,"name":"Pacific Rails Inc.","description":"It is 1862 and the US Congress has decreed that a railroad be built that will span the continent - linking the east coast and the west coast by rail for the first time.  The Transcontinental Railroad will be a epic feat of engineering - combining advanced construction techniques with raw human power and determination.  A fortune is to be made for those who can build the track the fastest!  Your task is to build an efficient team of workers, plan out your route and race the other players to connect both coasts first!<br/><br/>In Pacific Rails Inc., players are the Presidents of rival railway companies.  Using worker placement and resource management, players compete to build a continuous track from one side of the board to the other.  When the two sides meet, the end of the game is triggered and glory await those who have built the best railway.<br/><br/>The core mechanic of the game is worker placement.  On your turn, you either place a worker onto an action, or remove an existing worker.  If you place adjacent to one of your own workers, your actions are powered up.  Planning out a sequence of action is vital to get the best results.  Keep an eye on the other players and try to block them if they are building up to a super move.<br/><br/>You are also building up your team during the game.  Your engine starts with just the foreman.  You can hire extra Specialists to your train that allow you to build more track, lobby Congress and give you powerful actions.  Add in some carriage bonuses and you are on the way to creating a powerful engine that will allow powerful actions to be chained together producing epic turns that will show your mastery of the rails!<br/><br/>Once you have your track ready, you need to plan out the best route.  You need to have the tracks ready to match the terrain you wish to cover and decide which cities to connect and which to skip.  You must be able to complete a connection to the next city in one action - so make sure you're not missing any tracks!  Also watch what your rivals are up to - points are on offer if you can get them to use your connected cities.<br/><br/>In addition to the fun game play, Pacific Rails Inc has amazing art by Damien Mammoliti, well known for his work on the games Brass, Nocturion, and more.

Before the challenge to occupy another planet, however, we need to create a Moon base to extract resources from our natural satellite. Iron, titanium, water, and a powerful fuel, helium-3, are natural riches available in the Moon. To get these riches won't be easy; it'll require lots of work to install lunar probes, process extracted minerals, and ensure the working conditions of scientists and engineers in the crew.<br/><br/>In Luna Maris, you take on the role of a coordinator in charge of the lunar operations of a big company, organizing the crew, fulfilling demands, supplying worker's necessities, improving rooms in the complex, and respecting the strict environmental parameters. You start the game with six scientist cards, with which you can perform actions; to do so, place a scientist meeple in a room in the lunar complex, discard the appropriate scientist card, pay the activation cost (energy, water, oxygen, etc.), then receive the benefits of that room. The ten rooms each have their particularities and special rules:<br/><br/><br/>    Exploration Plant: Astronauts go out to the base to extract minerals.<br/>    Industrial Complex: Process extracted minerals. Also, control the air filters and decrease the CO2 emissions.<br/>    Greenhouse: Create food to sustain the crew members.<br/>    Expedition Area: Ship cargo to Earth and receive victory points.<br/>    Mining Room: Extract basalt and titanium to sustain a high level of production.<br/>    Communication Room: Hire better scientists and improve the human resources of the lunar base.<br/>    Power Plant: Juice the solar boards for an extra energy supply.<br/>    Recycling Plant: Recycle your waste to obtain resources in a green sustainable economy.<br/>    Laboratory: Use research to improve the Industrial Complex, Recycling Plant, and other facilities.<br/>    Dormitory: Take time off to recuperate.<br/><br/><br/>A game lasts five rounds, and during that time you can focus on installing lunar probes and producing raw resources; investing in the industrial complex to guarantee access to water and helium-3; hiring high-level scientists and optimizing your actions; or doing other things that will deliver victory points in the long run.

At the start of the game, two district cards are placed on each of the twelve spaces on the designated board. At the beginning of a round, the next two district cards, as well as two building and two profession cards (each from a deck of 54 of each type) are drawn to form the offer of six cards. Each of these cards has a cost in colored action cubes and grants a new action, special ability, or way to score points. In turn order, each player takes a card from those on offer. Finally, a market card is revealed that allows players to exchange money for victory points on their turn.<br/><br/>Next, the six colored dice are rolled. Each player decides which of the six dice they would like (players may choose the same die), then takes as many action cubes in that color as the number of pips.

If you own the original 1995 edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, or if you have the upgrade kit, you can continue playing those versions with no problems; those versions still stand the test of time quite well. In this Special 2004 Edition of Three Days of Gettysburg, we've done our best to improve and enhance the components and rules to this already classic game.<br/><br/>Specifically:<br/><br/><br/>    The six countersheets contain all of the original and replacement counters from the first two versions of the game, as well as some new counters and units with modified unit strengths and morale levels based on recent research. Rodger MacGowan and Mark Simonitch have revised and upgraded the original counter graphics, and these counters are printed on the higher-quality stock you've come to expect from us in recent years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark Simonitch has completely reworked the three game maps. He's used the original work and maps from Rick Barber and Joe Youst's first two versions as a base, and come up with another of his clean and elegant looks that makes these maps both nice to look at and easy to play on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The GBACW 4.4 rules that appeared in Gringo! were a major step up for the series in terms of both rules streamlining and presentation. We have further edited those rules and released version 4.5 for this new edition of Three Days of Gettysburg.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mark has streamlined and done new layouts on the game charts to give players the best mix yet of readability and utility in the least possible table space. We've also included some neat charts created by Mike Lemick that allow you to easily keep track of the status of each side's command and routed unit status..<br/><br/><br/><br/>    As you'll note from the graphic above, Rodger has created a whole new game box for this new edition of the game. We think it's some of his best work ever, and hope you agree. The game box is the crowning piece of what is, for a Reprint Edition, about as close to a brand new game, component-wise, as we could get (which is why there is no Update Kit for this version - it would essentially be a whole new game). <br/><br/><br/>So, if your original copy is showing some wear and tear, or if you want an edition of this classic game in which the updated graphics and systems outshine the original (and that is saying a lot), or you simply missed purchasing the first edition of this best-selling game, then this Special 2004 Edition is for you! Enjoy!<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>     A revised Command System, using Maximum Effectiveness to portray the strengths and vicissitudes of battlefield command.<br/>     Seven scenarios, from microcosm 1-mappers to the full 3-day battle.<br/>     Brigadiers rated with Action Profiles so that, when on their own, you may never know exactly what they'll do! Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain lost honor? Will a cautious Stannard sit and watch? Or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottle instead of the front line?<br/>     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, special rules for green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.<br/>     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack: you can roll up the enemy's flank in one massive charge. <br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 Scenario Booklet<br/>    1 Great Battles of the American Civil War Rules Booklet<br/>    6 Full-color Countersheets.<br/>    3 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>    1 Player Aid Card (11&quot; x 17&quot;)<br/>    1 Union AM Sheet<br/>    1 Confederate AM Sheet<br/>    1 Union Reinforcement Schedule<br/>    1 Confederate Reinforcement Schedule<br/>    1 Gettysburg Turn Track &amp; 2nd Disorder Card<br/>    1 Orders Chart/Terrain Effects Card<br/>    1 10-sided die<br/><br/><br/>Designer: Richard H. Berg<br/>Developer: John Alsen<br/><br/><br/>(user's description:)<br/><br/>The third edition, otherwise known as the &quot;2004 edition&quot; of this very popular tactical level simulation of the battle of Gettysburg.  The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game.<br/><br/>Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.<br/><br/>This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CYSqGJpe6tK9bLSDicnbRQ__thumb/img/ehn9vfAalwq2BVchfk9mHRuCovU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1525945.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CYSqGJpe6tK9bLSDicnbRQ__original/img/UMNfsVCg5EPxVYkblGEDzI5mlgo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1525945.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2004,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Richard H.

The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.<br/><br/>Warcradle Studios will supply highly detailed, high-quality miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog-filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.<br/><br/>Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall gameplay and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.<br/><br/>Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.<br/><br/>We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6YUfyBz4wFzYjWJ5tqEqcg__thumb/img/CW8HgH0zbA_JHfBY9OM7urkV8s0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic902315.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6YUfyBz4wFzYjWJ5tqEqcg__original/img/QSmHvPgRKI7LxY1tg8HcvZT_VKs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic902315.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2010,"publisher":"LudoPathes","designer":"Neil Fawcett, James Flack, Julian Glover, Alain Padfield, Franco Sammarco, Derek Sinclair","artist":"Robin Carey, Chris Drew, David Kidd, Jonathan La Trobe-Lewis, Christopher Peacey, Sally Taylor","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":7.22885,"avgWeight":3.16},{"bggId":257077,"name":"A Pleasant Journey to Neko","description":"You and your friends have decided to journey to the Antarctic harbor of Neko in hopes of seeing the cute penguins living in the backdrop of the stunning glacier landscape. To get to Neko smoothly, you each try map out the stops along your journey in order to see the most penguins. Your chances improve the farther your ships travel, the more harbours you visit, and the more goods you deliver. But avoid doing things that interfere with the Antarctica ecology and cause the penguins to move away!  Will you be the one that sees the most penguins?<br/><br/>A Pleasant Journey to Neko is a dice strategy game for 2-4 players. The game plays in four rounds across two periods, each with a mid-game scoring phase. In each round, players roll and draft their dice, which are used to exchange resources, activate existing card abilities, or bid on more cards.  Players can also take a number of free actions, including exchanging resources, adjusting their dice, buying and moving ships, and opening harbors to build more ship lanes.<br/><br/>Try to plan ahead by building ship lanes that create custom hubs!  These spaces give you additional locations to trigger powerful new actions.  But don&rsquo;t forget about advancing your ships too!  Not only do they score you points, but they can combo with the dice in the hubs you have created.<br/><br/>A Pleasant Journey to Neko has a unique dice drafting mechanism and card laying system. Over a hundred card combinations exist, making each game different and surprising. Also, don&rsquo;t forget about the advance mode, where you will face more challenges on  your way to Neko.

Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HLtSjoXRAGKXJSPZ2cCNBw__thumb/img/iV4nMVav_GEMl_xOn16fJmOtALA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic797346.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HLtSjoXRAGKXJSPZ2cCNBw__original/img/CrwJAdaHLIuM2epMtR5EHUtP--0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic797346.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"White Wolf Entertainment AB","designer":"Mike Nudd","artist":"Samuel Araya, Pauline Benney, Avery Butterworth, Becky Jollensten","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":6.39145,"avgWeight":3.1163},{"bggId":209951,"name":"Thunder in the East","description":"Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Frank Chadwick&rsquo;s ETO (European Theater of Operations) is a series of linked games covering the land campaigns of World War II in Europe using a constant map and unit scale, and common rules.<br/><br/>Thunder in the East is the first game in that series, this one covering the titanic struggle on the Russian Front.

This act turned out to be the precursor to what would happen just two years later. Cneo and Sexto, sons of Caesar&rsquo;s enemies, taking advantage of the influence that Pompey&rsquo;s name still carried and capitalizing off the rich resources of the Roman province, took control of all of Hispania, including the colonies of Italica and Corduba. These two traitors had somehow pieced together an army of no less than 13 legions, made up of veterans loyal to Pompey and the remnants of his defeated armies in Africa, along with citizens of Hispania.<br/><br/>Caesar promptly travelled to the capital of Hispania with the intention of crushing the rebellion while it was still in its infancy. After losing a battle to Cneo for control of the bridge, Caesar was forced to winter in Ategua and, as it was necessary to feed his forces, he subsequently pillaged the surrounding area. Many were those who joined the rebellion led by Pompey&rsquo;s sons, but in the end there weren&rsquo;t enough of them. Forced to take refuge in the city after the battle of Munda, Caesar besieges Cneo and Sexto. He later takes control of the city after a daring assault on the walls. Sexto manages to escape Caesar&rsquo;s wrath, but his brother Cneo dies along with another 22,000 citizens of Corduba. As punishment for supporting the rebellion and giving refuge to its instigators, the city is left a smoldering ruin. But from the ashes a new city will arise&hellip;<br/><br/>The year is now 27 BC, nearly two decades later, and Augustus, the first emperor, sends representatives of the most influential Roman families to Corduba in order to raise it to its former glory. To achieve this, it will be necessary to rebuild the city and cater to its inhabitants. All of this, of course, under the watchful eye of Rome.<br/>Players, who represent the heirs of different patrician families sent from Rome, will compete for the honor of becoming the next Governor, but must first win the vote of the people, and of Rome.<br/><br/>The game is played out over three eras, each one representing a decade. During a round, players will take actions in turns until all decide to pass. Players use actions to produce or harvest resources, construct buildings and monuments, train legions, and tend to the religious needs of the people. To do this, players will have access to a certain number of specialists and workers that will increase as the city&rsquo;s population rises.<br/><br/>It is important to note that Corduba is not a tile-laying game, but rather one of building actions that includes familiar worker placement and resource management mechanics.<br/><br/>Actions available at the beginning of the game are scarce and mostly limited to harvesting basic resources in order to construct buildings and train troops. However, as players construct new buildings, the amount of actions available increases, since each building constructed provides a new action. Players will certainly appreciate the sheer number of possible strategies and combinations that arise during the course of a game.<br/><br/>Another of Corduba&rsquo;s strengths is how a particular game evolves. A total of nine rounds are played, grouped into three decades. At the end of each round, the buildings release their workers and therefore become available for the next round. What this means is that all these buildings, which have been constructed one by one over previous rounds, are now free to all players regardless of who built them. Also, since there is an ever-increasing amount of actions available, strategic possibilities multiply. In addition to this, every action is just as important as the next, which leaves you with the constant feeling that another player has anticipated your move and occupied a building you wanted to activate or built what you wanted to build. Even though the rules do not change from one round to the next, players will quickly realize that the game does, since their strategies and perceptions during the first few rounds will be very different from later ones.<br/>There are no Victory Points in Corduba. In order to win, you will have to garner the favor of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants and of Rome itself. Constructing buildings in the different districts will improve your reputation there. Providing the largest armies for the Roman Cohorts or giving the largest offering to the gods will also help you win favor in the Senate, as well as, of course, helping the city meet the demands of Rome. At the end of each decade, players will have the opportunity to add to the Senate.<br/><br/>But not all that glitters is gold, and, on occasion, the citizens will rebel. Players will have to deal with these uprisings, but this does not mean they will have to cooperate. However, if this aspect is neglected, the entire city could fall, resulting in a very undesirable outcome &ndash; all players lose!<br/>Corduba is a bona fide example of a game with near-infinite strategic possibilities. Each game will play out differently depending on the buildings and monuments constructed, the combinations from families and inheritances that players choose, the demands of Rome, the fluctuation of the resource market, the Res gestae (milestones) available, etc. Even if you try to play in a similar way as you did the last, you will not have the same experience. Truly, no one game of Corduba will be the same &ndash; you will uncover different strategies and combinations each time you play.<br/>Corduba is a game of medium to high difficulty with simple rules that anyone can understand, but will profoundly challenge players of even the highest skill levels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O4ogFFwoLqS-d0aB_51Egw__thumb/img/j16We_sGv4vXUIOWFwhLWhysMU4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6332620.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O4ogFFwoLqS-d0aB_51Egw__original/img/rlJX8xY_kieYAmjXBEkJ8bQwH6Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6332620.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Ediciones MasQueOca","designer":"Manuel Martinez Aranda","artist":"Jesús Gutiérrez Llorente","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[2,4],"avgRating":7.93589,"avgWeight":3.8889},{"bggId":12355,"name":"Brigade Fire and Fury: Wargaming the Civil War with Miniatures","description":"Rules for American Civil war battles at the brigade level and suitable for battles with forces representing 15,000 to 1000,000 men.

His reign was full of prosperity in all areas, like culture, science and politics. His life and his famous court are said to be the ispiration for the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; collection of folk stories.<br/><br/>In Al Rashid, players will take the role of the heads of powerful families, and will use the members of their families for trading, travelling, and ultimately trying to exercise influence over the court of the powerful ruler.<br/><br/>Al Rashid is a mostly deterministic strategy game &ndash; with a slight hint of randomness &ndash; based on worker placement, influence, resource management, and the efficient scoring of prestige points (PPs). As heads of families, players will have three different worker types at their disposal: the Sage, the Merchant and the Pasha. The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.<br/><br/>The game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players's influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.<br/><br/>Resolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.<br/><br/>The resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.<br/><br/>The game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.<br/><br/>Every turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1NdH2ApZh4gMHsuj1D9-zA__thumb/img/BeCK__SuW6dAoWnXHJTK0snJ530=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1356506.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1NdH2ApZh4gMHsuj1D9-zA__original/img/ttJWk7U0pm9cXM9Xmi5Jwzqh2Io=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1356506.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Yemaia","designer":"Giorgio De Michele, Pierluca Zizzi","artist":"Simone Gabrielli","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.59963,"avgWeight":3.4615},{"bggId":331582,"name":"HEXplore It: The Domain of Mirza Noctis","description":"Krasvetelia.

A year down the line, you have become an active part of that society and honed the skills you need to fulfill your role there, but the mutants are gaining ground...<br/><br/>Posthuman Saga is a standalone survival game in the Posthuman universe. You play a seasoned member of the Fortress' militia, sent out beyond the defensive perimeter to explore and hopefully reconnect with outposts the Fortress has lost touch with, while searching for scavengable sites along the way. You have to forge across a crumbled land where resources are spare and mutants roam the ruined mansions and forests alike.<br/><br/>Like the initial Posthuman, this is a sandbox-style survival journey, but the game system in Posthuman Saga differs from that of the first game in the series. Players win by  completing various objectives that suit different characters and playing styles. It has an emphasis on tactical choices on two levels: the journey expressed through an innovative modular tile map puzzle and the individual  story and combat encounters. The latter are fast, card-based affairs involving tough choices with future consequences. Posthuman Saga boasts over one hundred, finely crafted story scenes with a simple, push-your-luck mechanism that supplements the emergent narrative afforded by the game.

During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach &mdash; and eventually inhabit &mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.<br/><br/>Many thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn's dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn's only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn's craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.<br/><br/>Voidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts' tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals' influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode &mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.<br/><br/>As the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors' infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn's infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__thumb/img/Ov6eWR87PZ2O1XYQtXMO6KvfzOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6153324.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__original/img/gIhusTrYRr_2JQGEv0zuSgLtuUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6153324.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2023,"publisher":"Mindclash Games","designer":"Nigel Buckle, Dávid Turczi","artist":"Ian O'Toole","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3],"goodPlayers":[1,4],"avgRating":8.14489,"avgWeight":4.4118},{"bggId":71668,"name":"After Pablo","description":"The bloody saga of Mexican and Colombian cartels following Pablo Escobar's death.<br/> It's 1994.

Each year, players will take four actions which might be to deploy new armies, enlist mercenaries, build fortifications and settlements, conquer new land, expand their influence, and much more. Each character has a unique pool of abilities and available actions, which will shape their game, whether its the Sultan, who cannot raise their own army and must depend on mercenaries, or the Murshid, who can use their political influence to interfere in other characters' battles. Players can purchase potent power cards, representing ploys, wise advisors, and specialist units from a market shared between all players. At the end of each year, players score points according to their own unique character objectives, and at the end of the game, the player with most points wins.<br/><br/>Crescent Moon is an area control game for four or five players. Take on the role of one of five radically asymmetric characters, each with their own objectives to fulfil, unique actions to utilise, and game-changing special powers to employ.

From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?<br/><br/>Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)<br/>     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)<br/>     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)<br/>     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)<br/>     Research (select an available technology)<br/><br/><br/>In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.<br/><br/>The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yt9Ued8Uzt1bAoSL2hMQXA__thumb/img/S0e6XgAtCcNRNbuKqzfG3mSjtD0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2061273.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yt9Ued8Uzt1bAoSL2hMQXA__original/img/gjqHrLRsisz183u7TnxN5k03kkk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2061273.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"(Web published)","designer":"Nigel Buckle","artist":"Nemanja Stankovic","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,2],"avgRating":6.93056,"avgWeight":3.1429},{"bggId":25008,"name":"Italia","description":"Italia brings to life almost 1500 years of Italian history, from 330 BC to AD 1100.

The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.

Welcome to the grimdark. Welcome to DAYNIGHTZ&trade;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dawn breaks on the refuge, and the sunrays bring you the feared news&hellip;the day has come, the day to go back to the city. When this damned thing started, you joined a group of survivors that had gathered in the woods, fleeing from the city. With tremendous effort, you erected a makeshift refuge to fend off the foul creatures, waiting for the army to come and save you. However, help is not coming, you know that now. And so do the traitors who quietly left the refuge last night, taking most of the remaining supplies with them. Now you are forced to go back to the city: It&rsquo;s the only option if you want to survive another day&hellip;<br/><br/>This is the starting point of DAYNIGHTZ&trade;. You get to pick a group of up to 4 survivors, each with its own character sheet that shows its attributes and abilities, a backpack and some equipment. Now you&rsquo;re ready to start your adventure in a nightmare world, where the dead rule above the living.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWhat is your goal?<br/><br/>That depends on the game mode chosen:<br/><br/>-&gt; In campaign mode you will have to brave narrative missions where you will have to fight and take difficult decisions, that will determine your progress, culminating in one of three possible endings.<br/>-&gt; In survival mode you will roam from city to city, with complete freedom to do whatever it takes to survive another day on this hell on earth.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow are you going to achieve your goal?<br/><br/>The game is divided in 3 segments: Adventure Phase, Travel Phase and Refuge Phase.<br/><br/>1) Adventure Phase: This is the most important phase of the game. In it, players will roam the streets and alleys of the city, exploring locales, suffering encounters and generally trying to keep a low profile while striving to achieve their goals (established by the campaign mission in the campaign mode or by their own interests in the survival mode).<br/><br/>One of the many things that set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other games is that is played on TWO LEVELS. What does that mean?<br/><br/>On one hand there is the City board, consisting of a labyrinth of streets, alleys, surprise zones and locations. On the other hand, whenever the players want to explore a certain location, or due to the triggering of events and conditions, players will lay out tiles to represent that particular location. Each location has its own set of tiles, depending on its nature. For example, the Firemen Park location consists of the parking tile, the locker room tile and the offices tile.<br/><br/>2) Travel Phase: Once the Adventure Phase is finished, survivors will have to trudge back to their refuge with their meager loot. In this phase survivors will have to face different situations, like zombie encounters, coming across abandoned structures (farms, etc) and being assaulted by other survivor groups.<br/><br/>3) Refuge Phase: This is a management phase, where survivors will have to handle, upgrade and defend their base. While in the refuge survivors can do a lot of stuff: recover from their wounds/infections, level up, stock supplies, farm food, upgrade the refuge&rsquo;s defenses&hellip;The refuge, though, will be attacked regularly by either roamer&rsquo;s packs or other survivor groups, who can also steal and sabotage your base. That is more likely to happen if you&rsquo;re away for extended periods, so try to do your city supply runs as fast as possible&hellip;<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the core mechanic?<br/><br/>DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is based on a double profile system, for both the zombies and the survivors: during the day, zombies use their worse profile, while during the night, zombie use their better profile and survivors will use their worse profile, unless they&rsquo;re equipped with a light source&hellip;which are obviously very scarce and run out very fast! The day and night cycle is controlled through a timetable located on the City board.<br/><br/>On top of that, other elements can make the brave survivor&rsquo;s life even more difficult:<br/><br/>- Threat Counter: Consists of a counter that increases as a result of diverse things happening, like survivors making noise, environmental effects, zombies amassing, etc. The higher the Threat counter, the higher the risk the survivors are taking by staying in the city.<br/><br/>- Threat Encounters: Each end of turn you will verify the conditions stated in a card. If you meet the conditions, you will suffer a Threat encounter. That might not happen very frequently but&hellip;beware when it does happen!<br/><br/>- The Hunter: The Hunter is the most dangerous zombie in the game. Luckily, it only appears at night; unfortunately, when it appears it will attack all the survivors who are out in the open (in streets and alleys). So keep this in mind: you don&rsquo;t want to be wandering around in the open at night!<br/><br/>- Survivor&rsquo;s health and stress: DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is a very realistic game. Thus, the more wounded your survivor is, the more difficult it will be for him/her to accomplish actions (in combat or out of it). Also, your survivor will be able to do less actions the more wounded he/she is. Stress is also key, as your survivor will be affected by events depending on their stress level, which can also impact on their attribute checks.<br/><br/>- Infection: Survivors can get infected when wounded by a zombies, while searching corpses or by other special effects. Once infected, the disease will deteriorate the survivor and if not treated, will end up killing him/her. Of course, the infection will be more easily neutered in its early stages; the more you wait, the harder it will be to remove it. While infected, your survivor will periodically succumb to its effects, which can make them bleed, make them slower, etc.<br/><br/>To help them deal with the situations that they will find themselves in, the survivors can use a lot of items that they will find in their city wanderings. However, all said items will either need consumables in order to function or will wear away with use&hellip;<br/><br/>The players will also encounter other survivors and animals during their travels, which, depending on the decisions previously taken and the success in the encounters, can join their group as allies.

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CokqERxkceU9XKnTT3rhLQ__thumb/img/TP3yYmJAxmfwN7t96tMnoCTv7Uw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic224206.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CokqERxkceU9XKnTT3rhLQ__original/img/SDNB-lOSU01uvi3gFZDokcQPcpI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic224206.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":9,"yearPublished":1974,"publisher":"Hartland Trefoil Ltd.","designer":"Francis Tresham","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6,7],"goodPlayers":[3,8,9],"avgRating":7.01217,"avgWeight":3.7619},{"bggId":21436,"name":"18FL","description":"18FL -- Railroads to Paradise<br/><br/>Designer's intro from manual: <br/>18FL is an 18xx game set in Florida. 18FL is a small 18xx game, in the style of Mark Derrick&rsquo;s &ldquo;one-state&rdquo;<br/>games 18GA and 18AL, and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.<br/><br/>It is my hope that it may serve effectively as a &ldquo;teaching game&rdquo; as well, allowing new players a relatively benign introduction to the 18xx family of games.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lumlEbKvQJHAw57Iht_XAg__thumb/img/O5segOoRprAknht64goC4aq-1GY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic148024.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lumlEbKvQJHAw57Iht_XAg__original/img/k4XJ1usuVEoVeRuQN4WQEUcjabE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic148024.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"(Web published)","designer":"David G.

The Circleville earthworks, as described in 1772, comprised an 1,100-foot diameter circle connected to a 900-foot square. Town director Daniel Dreisbach plotted the town directly atop the earthworks, integrating the town plan into the landscape. An octagonal courthouse stood directly in the center of the circular road system in the center of town.<br/><br/>To the dismay of Dreisbach, however, the people of Circleville hated the circular roads. People complained that the round roads forced everyone to build on oddly-shaped lots and caused confusion. By the mid-1830s, enough dissatisfaction arose with Circleville's unique radial concentric road layout that the townsfolk petitioned the State Assembly to change it.<br/><br/>The Circleville Squaring Company, authorized in 1837, undertook a project to convert the &quot;peculiar&quot; town plan into a more conventional grid.

In Sanctuary: Endangered Species, each of you will create a sanctuary for different endangered animal species. With the help of volunteers and rangers you will develop your facility, take care of your animals, and recreate their natural habitat as you try to save them from the impacts of civilization. You will maintain order and monitor animal's behavior &ndash; everything to ensure that the animals in your sanctuary are happy and safe.<br/><br/>The Sanctuary: Endangered Species is a worker placement game. At the beginning of each round, you lay out a row of cards each of which has a main action and side action. Players take turns placing their workers on those cards in order to perform actions. Each worker &quot;sees&quot; and can perform their main action and  any side actions that are within their line of sight, which is limited by other workers and by obstacles printed on the cards.

That June he led this Grand Army of over 600,000 men across the Nieman River to begin what he believed would be his greatest and perhaps final triumph: the invasion and subjugation of Russia. As the defending armies fell back before this prodigious onslaught, Tsar Alexander turned to a pugnacious and crafty old warrior to help save his country, his people and his Romanov Dynasty: Marshal Mikhail KUTUZOV.<br/><br/>Kutuzov uses the same basic rules system as found in The Napoleonic Wars, as it has been modified for even more interactive play in Wellington . As with the later title, there are no diplomatic or political rules: other than those which come into play should Imperial morale fall so low as to trigger the desertion of the Austrians or outright revolt of the Prussians. There are no naval rules other than a Russian ability to move between friendly ports and a &quot;Hornblower&quot; Home Card that allows for a Russian invasion on the Baltic Coast). Kutuzov is thus primarily a game of manoeuvre and combat, where players can recreate the sieges and legendary battles made so familiar to gamers as brought to life in such great books as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.<br/><br/>As this is Russia, however, not all enemies stand in solid ranks before you. Players must contend not only with their opponents but with Cossack raiders, Polish Lancers, often brutally horrifying attrition, fragile morale, treacherous allies, political events from outside the theatre of war and, of course, &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;General Winter&quot; himself, whose scourge effects both invader and defender of Holy Mother Russia.<br/><br/>110 Cards, most with quotes from the actual participants in that great struggle, drive the game and bring to it the flavour of being in Russia during the 1812 Campaign. The Imperials and Tsarists each have mini- &quot;Home Decks&quot; of a dozen cards each to share, thus increasing the chance that events, forces and options that were presented to the original contenders will arise during play. The other 86 cards, which include many &quot;Must Play&quot; political events, however, ensure every playing of the game will be very different.<br/><br/>Kutuzov comes with a campaign game that can last one, two, three or four turns - but which includes numerous mechanisms that can bring the game to a &quot;Sudden Death&quot; ending at the conclusion of or even DURING A TURN.<br/><br/>Mark and Fred, in seeking to deliver more value, variation and enjoyable gaming have provided two other game start scenarios which allow for the game to begin at the commencement of what would be turn two (On to Smolensk!) or turn three (Napoleon in Moscow) of the campaign. A fourth and rather unique method of play allows for two players to each take ONE of the powers from EACH side, in a highly competitive and unusual game of labyrinthine think and double-think. A fifth version allows for two players to play the game using a SINGLE hand of cards each, with &quot;chips&quot; to buy additional cards for their side as the play progresses.<br/><br/>The Campaign and the Scenarios:<br/><br/>&quot;Invasion&quot;: A Turn One game start should see the French and their Allies' military juggernaut smash across the border and attempt to catch and annihilate the Russians before they can mass to defend their Motherland Can the players surpass their historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&quot;On to Smolensk !&quot;: This permits players to avoid the border battles and initial French advances to begin play at a watershed of the Campaign: The Grand Army confronting concentrated Russian forces defending Smolensk immediately before Kutuzov arrives to take command. Will the French advance on Moscow as they did historically or seek victory through an alternative offensive direction&hellip;north to St. Petersberg or south to seize the Ukraine and other southern victory points?<br/><br/>&quot;Napoleon in Moscow&quot;: In this version of Kutuzov the bloody Battle of Borodino has been fought. The Grand Army reposes in Moscow awaiting Russian surrender or at least agreement to terms. The first chill snow of Winter has fallen, harbinger what's to come: should the French remain deep in Russia hoping to conquer the country or is it time to withdraw to better defences for the 1813 Campaign?<br/><br/>In all of the scenarios, the Imperial Powers have an initial advantage in numbers, leadership, Resources, and Morale. They are, after all, an Army that has never known defeat; a superb military instrument, led by the most powerful man in Europe with his devoted retinue of almost legendary Marshals. They face an enemy who has not tasted victory in Battle in nearly a generation, let alone full-scale war of the likes of which Napoleon wages. <br/>The French must take advantage of their superiority quickly, as that will soon dissipate in the immense marshes, unending steppes and fiercely fought over fields and cities of Russia. If they do not or can not succeed, then the advantage slips away to the forces of the Tsar, who, under Kutuzov, will not just be defending Russia, but will be advancing into the outer marches of that yet fragile empire led by their archenemy&hellip; Napoleon.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A6ZcHe2YhAxq3HmAw8Io_Q__thumb/img/QzmOJcwweSWuztVZGcRU5V49XUM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic368807.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A6ZcHe2YhAxq3HmAw8Io_Q__original/img/Ll6E0HOph2e_18OtPPrGC3y86oI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic368807.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Mark McLaughlin, Fred Schachter","artist":"Rodger B.

The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.<br/><br/>While players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important.

The game has 10 public companies including the Canadian Pacific Railway that starts on both the east and west sides of the board.<br/><br/>The game consists of an alternating series of stock rounds and operating rounds. Initially, there is one operating round between each stock round, and then once the first 2-train is bought, two operating rounds between each stock round.  The final set of operating rounds has three rounds.<br/><br/>In stock rounds, players act as investors, buying and selling shares in the various companies.

By mid-January of 1944, the Red Army had liberated the area north and east of the Dnepr and seized Kiev. Further south, they crossed the Dnepr bend, capturing Kirovograd and continued deep into the western Ukraine.  The Germans, however, maintained a hold on the Dnepr near Korsun in an exposed salient 70 miles southwest of Kiev.  Hitler insisted on holding the salient and refused requests from his generals to withdraw to more defensible positions.  This exposed salient was too tempting a target for the Soviets and in January, 1944 Stavka ordered the 1st &amp; 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to conduct a major operation; striking against the base of the salient to surround and eliminate two German Corps within.  The 2nd Ukrainian Front would breakthrough in the east on the 25th and race westward while the 1st Ukrainian Front would attack toward the east a day later; sealing the pocket at Zvenigorodka.  The Soviet offensive was a stunning success, slamming the gate on 60,000 men from six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking.  But, the Germans were not about to let the Korsun pocket become another &quot;Stalingrad&quot;.  Within a week they struck back with eight panzer divisions in a two-pronged counter-stroke of their own; this time to deal the Red Army an unexpected defeat from the Jaws of Victory.<br/><br/>Seven separate scenarios covering the period from January 26 to February 18, including a 25-turn campaign game, allow both sides plenty of opportunities for offensive and defensive action.<br/><br/>As the Soviet player, you begin with a two-pronged offensive, striking hard at the base of the German salient in an attempt to trap as many German units as possible.  If you succeed, you must then turn your attention southward to build the &quot;outer ring&quot; in preparation for the German counter-offensive, while systematically chewing away at the supply-starved defenders in the pocket.<br/><br/>As the German player, you must slow the Soviet drives from both east and west by fighting a two-front defense, and if possible bring them to a halt.  Once the pocket forms, you must skillfully hang on and preserve as many of the trapped units as possible, and wait for you Panzer Divisions from the south to carve open an escape route.<br/><br/>And both sides will have to contend with overstretched supply line, bad weather, and tank-stopping mud.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 2 miles / 3.2 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>    Five dual-side printed countersheet (1,170 1/2&quot; counters - 4 full size &amp; 1 half countersheets)<br/>    One 32-page Jaws of Victory Rule Book<br/>    One 28-page Jaws of Victory Play Book<br/>    One single-side printed Game-Turn Record Track<br/>    One dual-side printed Sequence of Play Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Phase Sequence Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed German Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Soviet Player Aide Card<br/>    One single-side printed Terrain Effects Chart<br/>    One single-side printed Combat Results Table<br/>    Eight Dual-Side printed Scenario Cards (4 German &amp; 4 Soviet)<br/>    One dual-side printed Combat Manuals/Credits/Historical wrapper<br/>    One single-side printed Game Errata card<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Moderate-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6-50 hours<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0_4HaT2y0bGSjt7DSTmnzw__thumb/img/z0v0f-a1PMPUmI4T0aQIjtMZRQw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5227968.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0_4HaT2y0bGSjt7DSTmnzw__original/img/NI1n2Y01zsDb53xKAVlHyrYnvKk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5227968.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"New England Simulations","designer":"Milt Janosky","artist":"Mark Hinkle","honors":"2020 Charles S.

Kończy się zaś śmiercią monarchy w 1572 r. W tym czasie graczom przyjdzie decydować o najważniejszych sprawach państwowych dotyczących wewnętrznej sytuacji kraju oraz roli Polski na arenie międzynarodowej.<br/><br/>Gra oparta jest na dw&oacute;ch gł&oacute;wnych mechanikach (licytacja oraz worker placement), kt&oacute;re znakomicie oddają klimat XVI-wiecznej Polski.

Mechanika licytacji zostanie natomiast wykorzystana podczas rozgrywania kolejnych sejm&oacute;w, na kt&oacute;re szlachta była zwoływana przez panującego władcę. Gracze, w trakcie trwania szlacheckich zjazd&oacute;w, dzięki pozyskanemu poparciu posł&oacute;w, senator&oacute;w oraz kr&oacute;la, będą walczyć o obsadzenie najważniejszych urzęd&oacute;w w państwie.

The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.<br/><br/>In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.<br/><br/>The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.<br/><br/>Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.<br/><br/>Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics. Dust Warfare players build armies from the exact same set of miniatures as Dust Tactics.

They were drawn by the very stones in the land which seem to call out to them. These stones soon became known as speaking stones as they were able to speak into the very souls of the adventurers, granting them power to push back the Tenebris. Once they arrived they found out they were not the only ones summoned by the stones.<br/><br/>The Stonebound Saga is a skirmish style card game that offers a variety of elements such as resource management, dice rolling, card positioning and tactical gameplay. The game is for 2 to 6 players played on a large grid-based playmat. Matches take 45 minutes to an hour to complete.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a group of adventurers who have made their way to the valley to train and prepare for the upcoming battle against Tenebris (Standard play is 3 characters per player). Throughout the game players will use speaking stone cards drawn from a community resource deck in order to perform various abilities in battle.<br/><br/>The Stonebound Saga is a great mix of unit positioning and strategy requiring each player to carefully plan their turns and manage their resources to achieve victory against their opponent. With a large number of character cards to fit many play styles, each match is always a unique experience.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Jr1cGRWDh8gBeg8yH_DQg__thumb/img/GpwMrn-hZhyzrJJ9qYqeb4qzqB4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3460838.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Jr1cGRWDh8gBeg8yH_DQg__original/img/fMAGQaNIDUHjW8Pn9XYmkykodXA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3460838.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Sky Kingdom Games","designer":"Eric Bittermann","artist":"Jason Nguyen, David Yanchick","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[4,6],"avgRating":7.33872,"avgWeight":3.1111},{"bggId":6861,"name":"Red Badge of Courage","description":"(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Red Badge of Courage extends GMT's popular Great Battles of The American Civil War system to cover both battles of Bull Run, or Manassas.<br/><br/>1st Bull Run, the opening battle of the Civil War, features two untrained armies, some exceptional and some truly poor leaders, and one of the best gaming situations in the war.

Eastern Empires can take up to 12 hours to complete, and still yet, it has a simple mechanism and is easy to learn. The players lead their civilizations, as they expand and collapse, from the Stone Age, through the Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age. Eastern Empires provides a full day of fun for larger groups.<br/><br/>Culture<br/>Though it may seem at first glance, Eastern Empires is not a wargame. Yes, conflict may be involved, but rather it is a game about history, culture, trade, development, and... calamities. The civilizations involved are all situated along the Silk Road and the Arabian Peninsula. The Babylonians, The Indus Valley civilization and The Nubians. Players develop their own unique civilization in arts, crafts, science, civics and religion. Each player starts his civilization with a single population token, 8000 BC, but grows and grows over time, and eventually cities can be built. Cities of course bring wealth and fortune, but also&hellip; natural calamities such as epidemics, famine or earthquakes, or civil calamities such as pirate attacks, slave revolts and civil disorder.<br/><br/>Trading<br/>This wealth is expressed in trade cards. The more cities, the more cards a player gets. These cards provide both trading commodities, and calamities. Trading is the heart of the game. A real social experience, where all players simultaneously trade with each other during a limited time. As soon as trading has ended, the players that end up with calamities will suffer them.<br/><br/>Develop advances<br/>And then, of course, it's time to do something about it. Build walls, give your citizens music and architecture. Develop religion, democracy, improve science&hellip; 51 different advances can be developed in five different categories.<br/><br/>Maybe a player can even construct a wonder of the world, or scatter their people all over the map, and gain cultural ascendancy. The player that knows best how to work together, trade or battle for territory, defend his people against nature or enemies like barbarian hordes, and stand the test of time, eventually will win the game. After up to 12 hours of playing that is.<br/><br/>Additional components<br/>Compared to its counterpart Western Empires (2019), Eastern Empires game adds additional components and scenarios that enable games with less than 5 players. Though the base game is especially designed for interaction between larger numbers, these new rules and components provide a well balanced smaller game that can even be used with its counterpart Western Empires. The game can be expanded with Eastern Empires: The Special Buildings Expansion (2019).<br/><br/>Mega Empires<br/>When combining the board games Western Empires (2019) and Eastern Empires (2021) this forms: Mega Empires (2021), an 18-player experience. A full game of Mega Empires takes up to 13 hours to complete. This bundle contains both stand alone games, each of which can be played by 3-9 players and can be expanded with the two Special Buildings Expansions (2019) for either game or the combination of both games. Where Western Empires has a focus on sea travel and trade on the Mediterrainean Sea, Eastern Empires follows the Silk Road to India and trading is done through the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Kul6zd2-HgXZpqvvdOWjfg__thumb/img/iX6X0fqwV8NnAq19u1PXMFenD98=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6220022.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Kul6zd2-HgXZpqvvdOWjfg__original/img/tUNZuC7FzJvxCYBu30XbK2P_Cvk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6220022.png","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":9,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"999 Games","designer":"Flo de Haan, Gerart de Haan, John Rodriguez","artist":"Franz Vohwinkel","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5,6,7,8,9],"goodPlayers":[3,4,null],"avgRating":8.78191,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":130134,"name":"Burning Suns","description":"Burning Suns is an intense tactical science fiction game set in an expansive universe in which you'll be competing for supremacy through technology, diplomacy, exploitation and destruction.<br/><br/>Tactical 4X thematic action &gt; Burning Suns is not a traditional 4X game.

Broadly speaking, instead of focusing on the city of Orl&eacute;ans and trade with the surrounding villages, player are now settling the Loire Valley. Players must farm and produce, found villages, and build fortresses and churches. They will experience times of prosperity and success, but also times of deprivation; they must defy hunger and plague, fight for their land, and perhaps conquer foreign lands to secure the lives of their settlers. In the end, however, there is peace and the joint administration of territories and villages.<br/><br/>The game includes two stories: &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; and &quot;The King's Favor&quot;. &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; is an epic story that spans eight so-called eras, and each era features different conditions and emphases. Sometimes knights settle down, with whose help you can conquer foreign territories, sometimes the plague threatens to decimate the population of settlers unless all have worked together to develop medicine.<br/><br/>&quot;The King's Favor&quot; is shorter, simpler, and more suitable as an introduction to the game. Over five eras, certain tasks have to be fulfilled by the end of each era, and those who fail to do so will drop out mercilessly. The threat of having to end the game prematurely provides a constant thrill, but all tasks are achievable, so that (usually) all players experience the end of the fifth era &mdash; but those who have concentrated only on the tasks will be punished because at this point everyone's achievements will be compared in the king's castle, and you will receive victory points for territory size, buildings, goods, and coins.<br/><br/>The different eras affect the parameters of play as well as the rules of the game, creating new strategic possibilities. This challenges players to constantly adapt to current conditions, giving you the impression of experiencing a story, but unlike in legacy games, these stories can be repeated as often as you like. The changes from era to era require a new way of looking at things from a distance, but this is made easier for players by a story booklet in which players will find not only all relevant information and rule peculiarities, but also hints of how to prepare for the upcoming game in the form of a narrated story.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t_pmmQxuZwVDQ4gHNqUvSA__thumb/img/A_cKJfTWuXt2dUu6aEuGUBiwV04=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4911042.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/t_pmmQxuZwVDQ4gHNqUvSA__original/img/pQ40JY4HZ5p9ZeTAO7jComfghFQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4911042.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"dlp games","designer":"Reiner Stockhausen","artist":"Klemens Franz","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[2,4],"avgRating":6.30941,"avgWeight":3.9333},{"bggId":298154,"name":"Rolling Stock Stars","description":"Rolling Stock Stars is a reimplementation of Rolling Stock. <br/><br/>     Shorter game (no purple companies)<br/>     Companies have variable powers / # of shares<br/>     Green and blue companies are less powerful<br/>     Players can sell corporations into receivership<br/>     Corporation valuation is abstracted away with stars<br/><br/><br/>Do you love 18xx games, but wish there was one with a shorter play time, a more realistic and sophisticated stock market, partnerships, and more math?

By placing the crown upon his head with his own hands, Bonaparte brought all of Europe to the brink of war. For by its very nature, the act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy of every government then in existence.<br/><br/>To restore the sanctity of the divine right and position based on noble birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw and pledged to remain at war against France until the Corsican usurper was overthrown and the Bourbon was restored. For the next ten years, the fate of the French Empire rested on the on the abilities of the man: as a warrior and as a peacemaker.<br/><br/>Now YOU command Napoleon's Grand Armee! From the autumn of 1805 through the climactic summer of 1815, the entire ten-year conflict between France, England, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Spain, is re-created in ten separate scenarios. Each historical scenario is presented as a separate two-player game with an average playing time of 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>&quot;War and Peace&quot;, Mark McLaughlin's classic wargame on Napoleonic conquest, is here revitalized and enhanced with completely updated graphics and production, and a completely revamped rulebook that incorporates all known errata, additional scenarios, and all official variants and optional rules.

It will allow gamers to replay not only the first three Crusades - the only 3 that focused on what we call The Middle East - but with scenarios that range from a 7-player version of the 1st Crusade to a 3rd Crusade scenario that supposes Frederick Barbarossa didn't drown in Turkey and his immense army reached the Kingdom of Jerusalem pretty much intact.<br/><br/>Onward Christian Soldiers uses numerous innovative mechanics, including: <br/><br/>    an Activation system that allows players to choose which leaders/armies they want to use most in a given turn, but not know when they will be available for such use.<br/>    a Movement system with no Movement Allowances or Costs, but a heavy emphasis on Attrition and the ability of commanders to &quot;keep going&quot;. Shop 'til ya Drop . . . <br/>    Combat mechanics that put a major, detailed emphasis on sieges and ravaging the surrounding areas, but still allow for the predilections of the various armies in field battles (such as the famous Frankish Heavy Cavalry Charge), as well as the abilities of their commanders . . . men like the great initial Crusaders, such as Raymond, Bohemond, Godfrey and Tancred, King Louis VII of France (and his troublesome wife, the famous Eleanor of Aquitaine), Frederick Barbarossa (if he stays away from the pool), the dangerous Nur ad-Din, the magnificent Saladin, and the one Christian the Muslims feared more than anyone, Richard Lionheart.<br/>    Movement and attrition go hand in hand in this game. Leaders may move as far as they want<br/>    The game uses three sets of cards (110 cards total). Each of the four Crusader factions -- Northern Franks, Southern Franks, Sicilian Normans, Germans -- and three Muslim factions -- Northern Syrians, Southern Syrians, Mosul Turks -- has three or four Leader cards, which the players secretly &quot;purchase&quot; at the beginning of the Game-Turn to create the Activation Deck that determines which leader goes next. In addition, there are two Event Decks - one for the Crusaders and one for the Muslims -- through which a variety of random events occur, ranging from taking cities via treachery to suffering added attrition through oppressive heat.<br/>    Normally, each Leader controls armies only from its own faction. However, a simple set of multi-faction rules controls situations in which either side wishes to combine their armies into larger forces, mostly for the sake of sieges against major cities. The Siege of Antioch, which usually happens early in the game, often requires such an army. The multi-faction rules particularly come into their own during multi-player games; here you can expect to see players bickering over who controls the combined forces, an important point considering that whoever is in charge when the city falls gains control over the city. If attacked while combined, the players of a multi-faction force have 30 seconds to decide who's in charge: if they don't, they defend using a mediocre formation.<br/><br/><br/>COUNTERS: 876 full color counters<br/>MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color map<br/>CARDS: 110 Cards<br/>OTHER:<br/><br/>     Two six-sided dice<br/>     First Crusade Rule book<br/>     Second and Third Crusade Rule book<br/>     Playbook<br/>     4 Player Aid cards <br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER Richard Berg<br/>DEVELOPER Neil Randall<br/>ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

At the end of 2018, the last coal mine in Bottrop closed its doors, bringing to an end an era in the Ruhr region that is second to none.<br/><br/>The game Schichtwechsel takes up this theme and shows simplified typical areas around the coal mining in the Ruhr area of the 1950s. As a player and administrator of a coal mine, you experience an exciting competition and live through a piece of Ruhr Valley history. You bring coal and overburden from underground to the surface, let your miner go through a &quot;shift at the colliery&quot;, produce coke, or build the typical colliery settlements.<br/><br/>A game of Schichtwechsel takes place over five rounds, and each round consists of three phases: The preparation phase in which, among other things, the amount of mined coal is determined; the action phase in which players use their action pieces wisely in turn; and a small end-of-round evaluation. After the fifth round is a final scoring. Schichtwechsel offers you many possibilities to get the best out of your coal mine in order to score as many victory points as possible at the end.<br/><br/>This game is the revised and improved version of the game Die lettze Zeche, which was created between June 2017 and March 2018 as a contribution of the games group Fair-Spielt of the Spielezentrum Herne to the funding project &quot;GL&Uuml;CK AUF JUGEND&quot;.

The game has been designed to ensure that, just as in reality, the commanders (you) are fully occupied with decision making from the outset. Your key objective is to outmanoeuvre the enemy army and concentrate your forces at critical points in the battle. This will then destroy the enemy's will to fight, deal a devastating blow to the morale of their commanders (your opponent) and allow you to win.<br/><br/>Our companion army list books will contain historical overviews and the organisation of hundreds of accurately researched armies, ensuring that your battles will be able to have a realistic and historical feel.<br/><br/>Also, in reality, some armies would be relatively small, consisting of as few as 5,000 men, whilst others would be enormous. Field of Glory will allow you to see what might have been had these forces been equally matched, using a points system, as each army can then be scaled up or down whilst retaining an individual mix and balance of troops to create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; encounters.<br/><br/>We started with a blank sheet of paper and looked at a wide range of possible mechanisms. Some concepts are entirely new. Others may look familiar at first glance, but interact with the rest of the rules in a completely new way, giving Field of Glory a style all its own.<br/><br/>In Field of Glory our most important objective is to make the game fun to play whilst retaining a strong historical feel.

The rails or the mines?<br/><br/>Soon however some mines are connected and the profits begin to roll in.

This 35-year long conflict saw the extinction of a large number of noble houses, and would eventually set the house of Tudor upon the throne.<br/><br/>In Crown of Roses, players take on the roles of the dynastic giants - the House of Lancaster and their Beaufort cousins, and the House of York. The four player game adds in the powerful House of Stafford, and the ever-scheming Richard Neville and his son, Richard of Warwick, the 'Kingmaker'.<br/><br/>Using intuitive mechanics, Crown of Roses offers players a historical feeling with tremendous strategic depth and excellent replayability. Unit starting locations vary with each turn and even with each game, and the use of blocks creates the &quot;fog of war&quot; of limited intelligence on enemy strength and deployment. Random game events throw a touch of the chaos of the era into the mix, and the multiple uses for the player action cards leads to a level of uncertainty where enemy plans are concerned.<br/><br/>During each game turn in Crown of Roses, players will play cards to perform actions such as improving their armies, influencing the locals to support them, collecting supplies or prestige, moving to attack enemy forces, to recruit new houses to your cause, calling another Royal Heir into the fray, or even changing the nature of the conflict through the use of player events.<br/><br/>Unit blocks rotate to show strength, and each army can have a variety of experience levels and combat capabilities. A novel roll to hit-based system is used to determine combat results, with better experienced forces scoring hits more often in battle.

Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 90,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.<br/><br/>The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.<br/><br/>The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War.<br/>Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign.

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.<br/><br/>The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.<br/><br/>During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.<br/><br/>If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IZZkfhQhFClHGwD5ZRA3_A__thumb/img/QtEzjmMNGx8r3n0mMnsyeaymzLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic822328.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IZZkfhQhFClHGwD5ZRA3_A__original/img/kyCxq1ZwUqGZWetWlIgTQW1_ZcU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic822328.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2011,"publisher":"Rio Grande Games","designer":"Walter H.

The continent has been bought and broken in two by experiments of a powerful corporation Cerbero. Now it kneels divided waiting for the fall. The government is non-existent and so are any laws of men. Desolated wastelands are roamed by mutated beasts, decades-old machines running on corrupted software and degenerate humans who are  even more dangerous. In those few pockets of civilization left people are more interested in survival than in progress. Values like compassion and responsibility are scarce &ndash; even scarcer are fuel and ammo needed to face new reality. But things are about to change as there are still those who care. Will you muster enough hope to fight for better future? Will you stand tall and shine the beacon of your courage in this darkest of times? The Waste is calling &ndash; better be ready to answer&hellip;<br/><br/>Waste Knights is a post-apocalyptic adventure game for 2-4 players set in dystopian Australia now called the Waste.  Each player becomes a hero who travels around the continent fighting monstrous enemies, accomplishing Tasks to acquire new Gear Cards and hoping to gain enough Reputation in order to fulfill the Mission being played. All players share a common goal set by the Mission, but only the quickest and the most cunning will manage to win!<br/><br/>Waste Knights features unique rules&rsquo; systems. Players need to manage 4 different resources: Fuel, Ammo, Health and Radiation as reaching a certain level in any means almost certain death in the Waste. They move using different Vehicles, face threats shown on Wasteland Cards and explore various locations on a modular, hexagonal map that is formed of 37 hexes. Combat is both deadly and rewarding as players set the range, utilize Combat Cards with different maneuvers and have various melee and ranged weapons at their disposal. Additionally the Waster, the person opposite the active player, controls the game to some extent choosing threats and making combat decisions for enemies.<br/><br/>But Waste Knights is not only about fighting and moving. Players progress by accomplishing Tasks &ndash; short quests given by inhabitants of the Waste. Some of them require tactical acumen, others are based on Skill tests or getting certain goods. Finally, a unique barter system allows players to trade Gear Cards of different colors as in the post-apocalyptic future there is no currency system whatsoever. Thanks to this some players will win by strength while others by brains &ndash; and all will have a good time playing!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOhH25TPDiKqIQ2dJPBpKQ__thumb/img/pPLjzA73LUbXh6KzRZRS3MfUI9Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2695002.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOhH25TPDiKqIQ2dJPBpKQ__original/img/eGvrgc59jTp1jgi7blZhimxufz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2695002.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Badger's Nest","designer":"Marek Mydel","artist":"Damian Bajowski, Aleksander Karcz, Piotr Rossa, Michał Teliga","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":6.52807,"avgWeight":3.6087},{"bggId":170909,"name":"Caçadores da Galáxia","description":"In a distant future, tiranic megacorporations haunt the galaxy.<br/><br/>Gigantic lab creatures serve as weapons on planets at peace.<br/><br/>Theres an excelent oportunity for certain corporations and people to gain power and influence becoming the next Galaxy Hunter.<br/><br/>Ca&ccedil;adores da Gal&aacute;xia (Galaxy Hunters) is a euro game of Work and Tile placement about war on distant planets, mech building and resource management.<br/><br/>You dock your workers into the planets to gather resources and buy equipment (tiles) to build a better Mech.

In 1915 a new combat system is used. This new system is detailed, but does a good job showing the complexities of trench warfare (retreats are scarce and losses are real high).

Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.<br/><br/>The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play. Full-color box-miniatures are placed on tilt-blocks and stacking tiles showing altitude, pitch, roll and heading and bringing the three-dimensional fight to life.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwtGjwYkkMCzBYESI5PVGQ__thumb/img/4tIfqyZ3mot8Jf8Ta3hI9Xmfm0E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic301949.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwtGjwYkkMCzBYESI5PVGQ__original/img/QFay_-hxSgDrKpP_DAI-3F8DdS0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic301949.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"Ad Astra Games","designer":"Philip A.

Each hero is equipped with a unique deck of action cards, providing unique ways to perform the standard actions...as long as Fate is on their side.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the forces of Darkness spread across the land, methodically crippling Farrenroc's influence in hopes of eventually laying siege to this last standing beacon of Light. Each game of Dark Frontier pits the heroes against a sinle army, contributing its own unique minions, captains, boss, and treacheries. Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.<br/><br/>Dark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night). These selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Oftentimes the timing of these actions is important to accomplish a quest or encounter, or to push back invading forces. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots.

In the Papal States, Pope Paul III knew he could rely on the strength of the powerful Orsini family to oppose the power of his enemies. In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.<br/><br/>In Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor. You&rsquo;ll play the role of one of the feudal lords of the Orsini and you&rsquo;ll manage one of four minor feuds, Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero or Mompeo, trying to earn the esteem of your lord. If you&rsquo;ll develop your feud in the best way you will manage to prevail over your rivals. Do not forget the supernatural forces that dwell in Bomarzo: your existence and your achievement will be influenced by how you manage to turn in your advantage the will of the monsters of the park.<br/><br/>Bomarzo is a game of deep strategy for 2-4 players, the short duration of which gives to the players' choices even more decisive importance. The careful management of resources will allow you to easily take advantage of the power of the monstrous deity of the park. Each turn you will be able to perform various operations in your fief and also you will have to choose which god ingratiate, through workers placement bound by auction. But beware: each divinity of the park requires a very specific offer to concede his favor otherwise unleash his monstrous fury on unwary visitors! To triumph in Bomarzo you not only need the best development but mostly to have tied your for-tunes to the most powerful and prestigious deity.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BwHOqRJUL2llZVvc8WzS1Q__thumb/img/EAKyTyNZYuSSwlVpDaqtwwH-vaI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2991736.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BwHOqRJUL2llZVvc8WzS1Q__original/img/1lEhxWqWlY2vwAu-7WkjSonH3UQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2991736.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Giochix.it","designer":"Stefano Castelli","artist":"Marina Fischetti","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":6.52369,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":282438,"name":"Throne of Allegoria","description":"In the land of Allegoria, Queen Gwendoline lies on her deathbed.

Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).<br/><br/>Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.<br/><br/>Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.<br/><br/><br/>As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.<br/><br/>There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.<br/><br/>Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PcBfBZb3cqi9y4ETbPpeQw__thumb/img/c7KYccv2Rso95nHPz4VACiF2i7c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic168409.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PcBfBZb3cqi9y4ETbPpeQw__original/img/5k4ZnPouSAZNUqKCtmENW6KOLis=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic168409.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2001,"publisher":"Avalanche Press Ltd.","designer":"Brian L.

The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.<br/><br/>Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.<br/><br/>In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.<br/><br/>During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ERxFy63c7lYYmkYSgF__Kg__thumb/img/RsgIzUmZcnrswcWCwq12ndyqnQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3114486.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ERxFy63c7lYYmkYSgF__Kg__original/img/x7nx1DGW9LhMImwSLsVxuNefTeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3114486.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Devir","designer":"Marco Maggi, Francesco Nepitello","artist":"David Parcerisa, Jordi Roca Parse","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":6.43572,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":5034,"name":"Empire of the Rising Sun","description":"Pacific Theater version of Advanced Third Reich.<br/><br/>Can be combined with Advanced Third Reich for a Global War game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bPBHSR2XbvyUeZFXS4Y1fw__thumb/img/tLsg8sNxkDn7oKUZnGIYi4Ic5mg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic78323.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bPBHSR2XbvyUeZFXS4Y1fw__original/img/nmS7-hLHsc5XECdBZ8LvkkdLaCI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic78323.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":1995,"publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Co","designer":"Tor Abrahamsen, Dave Casper, Bruce Harper","artist":"Charles Kibler","honors":"1995 Origins Awards Best Modern-Day Board Game Winner","bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[1,3,4],"avgRating":6.79023,"avgWeight":4.3333},{"bggId":318450,"name":"Bios: Mesofauna","description":"Bios:Mesofauna is an alternative Bios:Megafauna.

It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.<br/><br/>There are 400 (7 are blank) 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's &quot;untried&quot; status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.<br/><br/>On each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.<br/><br/>Invasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.<br/><br/>Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/etTnHS86JZemZSVK33Et0Q__thumb/img/GkA35RusnRu0UzzN1G82AW6AO3U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic178463.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/etTnHS86JZemZSVK33Et0Q__original/img/5kCR2B7X5YouOF_zWRakpw8rOoQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic178463.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1976,"publisher":"SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)","designer":"Jim Dunnigan","artist":"Redmond A.

Each player rules over a civilization in the ancient world, attempting exploits that will be remembered long after the civilization has withered. Each turn, players will select two action cards, which represent edicts delivered by the player to his populace, announcing what aspects of the empire he/she wishes to address:  building structures, implementing advances, migrating population, initiating combat, annexing new territories, instituting reforms to manage the empire&rsquo;s unrest, building trade routes, demanding tribute, and -- crucially &ndash;- recording Chronicles about his/her reign.<br/><br/>The central element of the game's scoring system, Chronicle cards represent claims of great accomplishments.  To score a chronicle, the player must have a &quot;heritage&quot; level commensurate with the claim he/she is making:  claims of great works will only be believed and perpetuated if the player's civilization has established a reputation in the relevant civilization category (cultural, civil, or political).<br/><br/>Actions generally require the payment of resources (crops or gold), and action costs correlate either to the player's empire size or the player's Unrest level.  Unrest increases when a player's territories become too crowded, or when a player re-uses an action card, or when a player voluntarily presses on his populace to squeeze additional productivity out of them.  Managing Unrest is a central concern for the player throughout the game.<br/><br/>Players must strike the right balance between competition and peaceful interaction with their neighbors, to propel their civilizations from insignificant, forgettable kingdoms into empires worthy of the attention of historians!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LwHaHWbX046OevM3TY23xg__thumb/img/ROKLsORG_5dX9BfPqDZNXHFBAB4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4050100.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LwHaHWbX046OevM3TY23xg__original/img/4wGZTHDwBB0T5URzA0zju7-4NQg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4050100.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Spielworxx","designer":"Jeff Warrender","artist":"Harald Lieske","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.70304,"avgWeight":4.2353},{"bggId":204055,"name":"Warehouse 13: The Board Game","description":"The Warehouse is a massive, top-secret government facility in South Dakota that houses dangerous and fantastical objects. Agents assigned to the Warehouse risk their lives to retrieve these artifacts to keep them away from nefarious individuals who seek to use the artifacts for personal gain. In Warehouse 13: The Board Game, players take on the role of Warehouse Agents who must work together to retrieve these artifacts. But is everyone looking out for the Warehouse's interests, or might one of the Agents be secretly working for the Warehouse's most ruthless adversary?<br/><br/>Warehouse 13: The Board Game can be played by three to five players in about two hours. Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.<br/><br/>After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent must perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent must draw a free Trait.<br/><br/>The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.<br/><br/>Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly. If the Agents believe they have determined who the Traitor is, they can vote to Bronze that player, which reveals their Loyalty.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkhubY9kZqnmc3U3A-CEZw__thumb/img/Tm6Iaj7cjPVMow0VfYdif5KF9EY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3358873.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xkhubY9kZqnmc3U3A-CEZw__original/img/tNaWd_0V6N0UEysOJ-B5ObUlkI8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3358873.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Infinite Dreams Gaming","designer":"Michael Aldridge, Russ Rupe, M.

Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.<br/><br/>(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)<br/><br/>Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.<br/><br/>The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.<br/><br/>Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.<br/><br/>Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1<br/>power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.<br/><br/>Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6h2-_jM23HFv4F3IMrAZOw__thumb/img/tAhGZf9CK28GvfyzLa49zT8_zoE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic75374.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6h2-_jM23HFv4F3IMrAZOw__original/img/AE4cJtYZ1tVZykziSn2M5dn0sIw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic75374.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1981,"publisher":"Excalibre Games, Inc.","designer":"S.

NATO simulates a potential NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict in Central Europe during the Cold War years of the 1980's. First published in 1983, this game was Victory Games best-selling title, purchased by over 75,000 gamers worldwide. This new edition is based on an exhaustive two-year study by the Designer of the records that have come to light since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The game combines highly accurate information on the forces the Warsaw Pact actually had with now de-classified reports from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency regarding what satellite surveillance and HUMINT revealed about their actual plans. The map has also been extensively updated with new satellite geography. Finally, the game system has been reworked to better reflect the fluid, fast paced and deadly nature of modern warfare, while retaining the original intention of simple and intuitive play. Here is the ultimate Cold War game, remastered, and playable in a single sitting.<br/><br/>NATO is a division/brigade level simulation of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. The game map depicts the area from Denmark to the Swiss Alps, and from France to Poland.  The time frame covers the first 14 days of war, after which one side or the other has usually run out of an army. The game offers four different Scenarios, covering 1) a surprise attack from a standing start, 2) an attempt by the WP to quietly prepare without tipping NATO off beforehand, 3) an extended buildup of forces by both sides before war breaks out, and 4) an introductory scenario covering the invasion of Denmark.<br/><br/>Each Scenario can be played with an Order of Battle from 1983, when NATO was still relatively weak, or with an Order of Battle from 1988, when NATO had rearmed and reorganized and was at the peak of its strength. The difference is impressive.<br/><br/>The game features infantry, armor, airborne and airmobile troops, marines, with easy mechanics to leverage combined arms operations. It also has extensive options for employing air power, chemical weapons and, for the truly desperate player, a last resort to nuclear weapons. The combat system is built around the concept that the best defense is a good offense, and features artillery, tactical and operational air strikes, reserves, counterattacks and deep exploitation, allowing for a rich set of tactical nuances in play. This is not a game where the WP attacks and NATO defends.

The game system, shared with our earlier popular Panzer game (which covers battles on the Eastern Front), easily incorporates myriad details such as armor thicknesses at various points, shots from various angles, heights, and altitudes, and the effects of terrain. The rules cover the important aspects of small unit tactics - armor piercing shots, small arms fire, high explosives, artillery barrages, air support, communications, turret rotation, gun depression, mines, roadblocks, barbed wire, smoke, and much more. The flexible scenarios cover a variety of combat situations that are resolved on the six-piece geomorphic mapboard, which also features movable terrain pieces. The types of units include infantry, anti-tanks guns (including the deadly 88mm), Matildas, Crusaders, Bren Carriers, Long Range Desert Group Trucks, Honeys, Grants, Shermans, M13/40s SEM 41s, a large variety of Pz IIIs and IVs, halftracks, and much, much more.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fY9V-gH6-UE_YKpT8dQM1w__thumb/img/yMcdfypBMX7aOWVFcm9GGvkMhRQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic412210.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fY9V-gH6-UE_YKpT8dQM1w__original/img/iAceYZPfpdnk4Bq_sXHlXfW5KQU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic412210.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":10,"yearPublished":1980,"publisher":"Yaquinto","designer":"James M.

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic &quot;stalemate&quot;.<br/><br/>Since victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance.

The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.<br/><br/>A haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise.

They take these cards, discard one of their choice, then separate the remaining five cards into two piles, one containing two cards and one containing three. You do the same for another player, then take your two piles, discarding one of them and playing the other.<br/>    The Collect Phase: Collect items and bonuses indicated on the cards in your hand. You may also pay time tokens to perform extra actions in the next phase.<br/>    The Action Phase: Simultaneously take actions based on your cards in hand and those that you chose in the collect phase. Disputes caused by the simultaneous nature of these actions are resolved using the influence track, where the player at the top of the track chooses the outcome; choosing in your own interest, however, drops you to the bottom of the track.<br/><br/><br/>Rounds continue in this way until a player gains any of the seven victory conditions available, such as collecting all four ganbaru tokens or discovering another player's secret location and achieving any two of the ganbaru tokens.<br/><br/>Philosophia: Floating World contains over 200 tarot-sized cards and 12 intricate miniatures and is filled with beautiful Ukiyo-e style Japanese art, all digitally remastered to regain the original vibrance of the era.

Witches, its last remaining practitioners, have always been outcasts and could help human society only in strict secrecy. The leader of their people, the Septima, has always been the wisest, most knowledgeable witch. Now, as her time is coming to an end, witches from all over the world gather at Noctenburg to leave their mark on the hostile town and prove to the Septima that they are her worthy successor.<br/><br/>Septima is a competitive, highly interactive strategy game of witchcraft. As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials. But beware: magic, even if used for good, invokes suspicion in the townsfolk...<br/><br/>Simultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima&rsquo;s central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.<br/><br/>Rescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players&rsquo; coven can end up in yours.<br/><br/>Accessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games&rsquo; most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Villő Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bern&aacute;t, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms.

For the Israelis you have battalions of Centurians, M60, M48 and Super-Sherman tanks plus a wide variety of mechanized infantry. Also, you have all their artillery to support this fast moving array. For their big counterattack, the Israelis will be using everything from the long ranging 175mm guns to captured Russian 130mm cannons.<br/><br/>In the air, the combat is equally exciting. The Air Module is almost a complete game in itself. Once again everything is there. The Israelis have Mirage III's, Skyhawks and the deadly Phantoms; all individually represented. There are even separate counters for both Huey and Chinook helicopters.<br/><br/>And now pouring across the canal and up the Golan Heights come the Arabs. With their low silhouette T-62's and fast moving BTR personal carriers, they represent a formidable challenge to Israel.<br/><br/>And they too are accurately represented , complete with Saggar anti-tank missiles and both mobile and fixed SAM sites. Their air force also has individual counters for the MIG-21's, 19, and a few 23's, in addition to SU-7 and SU-11's. They too, have their divisional and corp level artillery.

By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.<br/>The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.<br/><br/>THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.<br/>Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.<br/><br/>Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/>Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.<br/><br/>Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.<br/><br/>The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.<br/><br/>There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it.

Be it at the brothel or at the market, men such as the Pope or the Emperor can be seen hard at work at any time of the day. Even the most miserable miser, though, would be well advised to also strive to get hold of enough precious stones and wine to make sufficient donations towards the Lord's cathedrals. After all, it is through pious generosity that a poor soul can gain the all-important letters of indulgence and be pardoned for a life of greed and lust. When all is said done, what matters is to have sinned just enough to have achieved all goals and gotten away with it, while others took the fall.<br/><br/>In more detail, to win, players have to end the game with their &quot;poor souls&quot; closer to heaven's gate than their opponents. Alas, throughout the game these poor souls pretty much exclusively move in the opposite direction, i.e., towards Hell. Only at the very end of the game might players climb back towards heaven, depending on the letters of indulgence that they managed to collect up to that point.<br/><br/>The accumulation of these letters of indulgence is each player's primary goal. To this end, they take on the roles of different people: the Pope, the Emperor, the Merchant, or the Little Sinner. Each round, these roles in turn grant them access to different special actions. On their turn, players buy or sell goods on the market, visit the brothel to benefit from personal connections, or secretly donate money and goods to the church. Meanwhile, the construction of the game's three cathedrals proceeds. As soon as a cathedral is fully erected, the church will hand out the all-important letters of indulgence. However, only those who have donated the most in either of three categories will actually receive anything.<br/><br/>Many perks that can be used during the game require the players to &quot;sin&quot;. Sins are tracked by means of a tally stick and will move the player's poor soul closer to hell. The player who strikes the right balance and picks the right roles at the right time will be able to collect the most valuable letters of indulgence and might stand chance at winning the game. If a player has burdened themselves with too much sin, though, all will ultimately be for naught.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yXU6z6pl-Kkn7KRUpiCKiw__thumb/img/rdeSRR98yXhlvfaprZbPjgTIQTE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3108106.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yXU6z6pl-Kkn7KRUpiCKiw__original/img/pzgU094wmqlD105xH7RkTvxbBcU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3108106.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Lion Rampant Imports","designer":"Rüdiger Kopf, Klaus Zoch","artist":"Franz Vohwinkel","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.18923,"avgWeight":3.0833},{"bggId":2844,"name":"Throneworld","description":"Players expand from their home world to explore systems, starting at the edges of a board and working inward towards the center Throneworld.

These extraction plants will allow you to obtain different types of resources. As you&rsquo;re all employees of Stardrill, once placed these buildings can be accessed and used by any player!<br/><br/>Place pipes branching out from your main base to create the extraction network that will bring resources into the hold of your cargo ship. Each time you integrate an extraction plant into your network by joining a section of pipe to it, it activates, gaining you a unit of the resource of the building&rsquo;s type.<br/><br/>Once obtained, these resources will have to be managed carefully, as you only have a limited amount of space in your hold! When full, no more resources can be added without spending or jettisoning others first. <br/>Some resources have value during the game and can be spent to free up space in your hold, while others can only score points at the end of the game - so you&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye on the space you have, and time your activations carefully.<br/><br/>There are 6 resources available on Titan: Deuterium, Hydrocarbons, Silicium, Titanium, Water, and Tholin.<br/><br/>However, not all of these resources are desirable.

Picking some of it up is impossible to avoid as you dig deeper into the centre of Titan, but don&rsquo;t let it get out of control &ndash; as well as losing you Credits, if you take Tholins into your hold when it is already full, some of your precious cargo will be contaminated!<br/><br/>Stardrill has also supplied you with a team of trusty drones that will lend you on claw on your mission. As well as transporting valuable resources and moving Tholins away from your network, Drones can dock to an Extraction Plant to increase its yield or make it less costly to upgrade. These handy machines can also use Titanium to destroy pipe sections, either in another players network, or even your own!<br/><br/>Earn Credits during the game by placing and upgrading Extraction plants, completing Stardrill&rsquo;s special Objectives, and fulfilling Planetary Orders.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll score Credits depending on the contents of your hold!

Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).<br/>     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out.

Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council.

The game will last until a number of civilizations reach the Bronze or Iron Ages, when points will be awarded for the territories and cities occupied, technologies discovered, trade goods obtained, Wonders built and treasure.<br/><br/>One distinctive element of the game is the use of a deck/pool-building mechanic mixed with role selection (similar to Eminent Domain) by which players draw a generic action of their choice to boost their hand every turn. This is done with little chips instead of cards, where chips in four different colors are each associated with a couple of possible actions. For instance, players can use blue chips in their hand (fleets/caravans) to expand to an adjacent maritime region, or, to trade goods and discoveries with other players.<br/><br/>As the game progresses and civilizations advance, the map will become gradually more and more crowded, players in turn will increase their hand sizes, and their chips will become more and more efficient by means of technological advancements, thus gradually increasing in complexity of negotiations and military tension. So the core of the interaction between players comes not much from direct conflict, but from the constant negotiation everyone is subject to, for the purpose of establishing accessible trading cities and beneficial exchanges, all the while procuring secured &ldquo;buffer zones&rdquo; between their Capitals.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pw6hH8NlBcSN1FUUx5E37w__thumb/img/9__JofSTiOa4EKa9-SPVO-xyWpQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2670843.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pw6hH8NlBcSN1FUUx5E37w__original/img/rcXqOqlrlulSurarSo44bj0UGrw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2670843.png","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":7,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"El Dragón Azul","designer":"Juan Carballal","artist":"Pablo Camarasa, Marcelo Guerrero","honors":"2016 Premio Alfonso X Mejor Juego Nominee","bestPlayers":[5,6],"goodPlayers":[4,7,null],"avgRating":7.70684,"avgWeight":3.4667},{"bggId":180853,"name":"Zephyr: Winds of Change","description":"Soar above the clouds in an array of airships.

Each player takes on the role of an airship captain. As a recent recruit to the band of vigilantes called Zephyr, each player must outfit their own vessel and work together defend the last remaining shred of civilization from malevolent marauders and unrelenting warlords.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players upgrade their ship and hire crew members. Each of these brings unique abilities and can help you customize your ship and fill a unique role on your team. Each game you select a mission which shapes its overall structure, length, and difficulty. Join us, a vessel in Zephyr awaits its captain.<br/><br/>Game Details:<br/>This is a 1 to 4 player cooperative modular adventure with rogue-like elements set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk environment. Players pick their ship and can spend their starting resource to add tokens to their ship and cards to their deck. They can also hire crew which are a modular component that comes by combining two cards, which each give unique abilities, and adding them to your ship. Players choose a mission which each has a different lengths and difficulty which maps out starting supplies, the win event and the structure between. Players travel on their selected mission through a series of regions. Each of these has a unique global effect for the area. Each turn, or day as we call it, each player draws an exploration card which causes them to make decisions, deal with random events or fight in battles. Battles are a large portion of the game since you will deal with them on the way to and during a warlord battle or most end events. During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage. This process repeats until one side or the other has been destroyed. When you win a battle you take the due rewards which can be used to trade for additional ship upgrades or crew members. These augmentations help to prepare your ship for the end conflict and ultimately win the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LN5KJbGBoo3AYLOpyYSSaQ__thumb/img/qQplShMQ23hY-A1wOpPyWpXUBJQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3358768.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LN5KJbGBoo3AYLOpyYSSaQ__original/img/doEysJt0zZMavnnF9ejxU6zaxZc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3358768.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Portal Dragon","designer":"Aaron Kluck, Jon Mietling","artist":"Jon Mietling","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":7.02005,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":173776,"name":"Battle for Biternia","description":"Battle for Biternia combines the aesthetic of classic role-playing video games with the gameplay of the wildly popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre.<br/><br/>Take control of a team of four heroes and do battle with your opponent.

Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.<br/><br/>When we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic &ndash; as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.<br/><br/>The First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.<br/><br/>To guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation&rsquo;s own will to fight while degrading the enemy&rsquo;s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.<br/><br/>1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War. Two to five players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations. What forces to produce, where to commit them, when, and how? No two games of Fatal Alliances play the same, no strategy is foolproof, and any decision may have unforeseen consequences.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pYrAMItecIMYkipztEAvWw__thumb/img/91PQoE-UQZGVX6BZGZUTqmpp-4Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2673386.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pYrAMItecIMYkipztEAvWw__original/img/wfj6ureQ9iO0WwEKGEz_3WioCDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2673386.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Andrew Rader, Harry Rowland","artist":"Mark Mahaffey, Andrew Rader","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,4,5],"avgRating":8.025,"avgWeight":4.1429},{"bggId":99132,"name":"2019: The ARCTIC","description":"&quot;Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, in agreement with Russia, warned USA to &ldquo;keep their hands off the Arctic.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Despite the cover picture &quot;2019: The Arctic&quot; is an economic game, however some military aspect is also included.

France and the UK reacted immediately, activating the Dyle-Breda Plan, and thus committing their best forces directly into the trap.

The game is recommended for two, three or four players: one/two control the Western Allies and the other one/two control Germany and Italy.

The basic game rules introduce the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember. Then the advanced game rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of fuel and the advanced production system. Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, optional rules can be added as desired; these include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, and Parachute Assaults.<br/><br/>Blocks in the West can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the East and Blocks in Afrika.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s_XDIjn3aQDuoGWSMmC2-Q__thumb/img/b9XWgJ126mrIhYrPxrSaJXOaqnI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1706730.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s_XDIjn3aQDuoGWSMmC2-Q__original/img/4HvjcgUgTxnmjUZtgJCCsENedLs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1706730.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"VentoNuovo Games","designer":"Emanuele Santandrea","artist":"Elisa Ferrotto, Emanuele Santandrea","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[1,3,4],"avgRating":8.05692,"avgWeight":3.6429},{"bggId":263222,"name":"Shards of the Jaguar","description":"Shards of the Jaguar is a competitive &ldquo;dungeon-deduction&rdquo; game, which requires both strategic and tactical thinking.

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fiefs and Bishoprics. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery, and deception!<br/><br/>FIEF is a classic game and this edition includes a new board (FIEF France: Gameboard)!<br/><br/>The game board represents the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre. Bishoprics include several different Fiefs' villages.<br/><br/>Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.<br/><br/>In FIEF France edition, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl, or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, they gain 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!<br/><br/>You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to attain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies by some other foul means!<br/><br/>In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot;, and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly affect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprising&quot;!<br/><br/>Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.<br/><br/>Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men-at-Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Archers and Bombards. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner.

General MacArthur still favored the more westerly route through the Philippines and had support amongst the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It took several conferences and nearly a year before the decision was made. There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement. With all these reasons, a battle for the Marianas was inevitable.<br/><br/>On 15th June 1944 71,000 American Marines and Infantry attempted to make the plan work. 32,000 dug-in Japanese attempted to stop them.<br/><br/>Saipan &ndash; The Bloody Rock will be the first game to utilize the new Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 2 maps. This will be your chance to experience a full-on naval invasion as Amtracs and DUKWs head towards the emplaced forces of Imperial Japan.<br/><br/>The game will come with 4 scenarios and 2 campaign games:<br/><br/>Dog-Day &ndash; The first day of the Invasion. It is 8 turns long and fought on a single map. An excellent introduction to both the system and the game.<br/><br/>First Week in Hell &ndash; The first week of the invasion and the capture of Aslito airfield. This scenario is 56 turns long and is played on a single map. For the space but not time challenged players among you.<br/><br/>Death Valley &ndash; This scenario covers a single day of the fighting and concentrates on the American attempt to capture Mount Tapotchau and the area that became know as Death Valley. 8 turns long and a single map. An excellent large battle you can play over one sitting.<br/><br/>Shattered Jewels - This scenario covers a single day of fighting and revolves around the largest Banzai attack of the war. Thousands of Japanese attack the 105th Regiment near the town of Tanapag. Variable length but usually 4-5 turns.<br/><br/>The Battle for Saipan &ndash; The full historical campaign from 15th June- 9th July (224 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Saipan in 1944, from the first invasion at Charan Kanoa in the south, through the long bloody fight in the central mountains around Mount Tapotchao and finally to the last Japanese stand in the north.<br/><br/>Bloody Rock &ndash; This is a hypothetical campaign game that lets the players decide how to defend Saipan and how to invade it. The American player receives the same historical forces but now has the opportunity to devise his own landing schedule over one of 25 beaches. The Japanese player gets to prepare his own defenses; set up pillboxes, lay mines and deploy 6&rdquo; naval guns etc. Can you do better than history?<br/><br/>Complexity: 6<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability:8<br/><br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours<br/><br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters<br/><br/>Unit Scale: Companies and below<br/><br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vY1uRFe9AsokBnfOcljWLQ__thumb/img/dZn6KpdM60rd0rx0FXaIme_tpIw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4183415.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vY1uRFe9AsokBnfOcljWLQ__original/img/o3jlxF05eD6TK3yucRvrwXWuRNg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4183415.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2017,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Ross Mortell, Adam Starkweather","artist":"Antonio Pinar","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4,null],"goodPlayers":[1,3],"avgRating":8.05351,"avgWeight":4.0},{"bggId":158793,"name":"Atlantic Wall: D-Day to Falaise","description":"(from Decision Games' website)<br/><br/>ON 6 JUNE 1944 the greatest armada the world has ever seen approached northern France. That fleet consisted of more than 5,300 ships carrying over 300,000 men and 50,000 vehicles. Opposing them was Germany&rsquo;s veteran Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>ATLANTIC WALL is a grand-tactical simulation of that campaign. The counters represent almost every formation that participated at the company and battalion level. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, commando, glider and headquarter units are fully represented. Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.<br/><br/>There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign. The Amphibious Assault Module is played on a special Beach Display that shows each sub-area of the invasion beaches with units depicted at the company level. It can be played as a solitaire scenario. The campaign game can be played from 6 June to 22 August, with a total of 234 game turns.<br/><br/>This is the third instalment of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (GOSS), the first two being: Wacht am Rhein and Hurtgen: Hells Forest. All three games share a common rules set that&rsquo;s been extensively updated and revised to simplify game functions while still maintaining the design of the earlier games. In addition to the basic rules, Atlantic Wall includes a set of exclusive rules to cover the special requirements of the amphibious and airborne landings and the logistical system required to support the armies coming ashore.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qx_Ikwg_0GxWSUv-WG618g__thumb/img/zPywfsmPX5jWrx8j0k2iehOmRSk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2009623.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qx_Ikwg_0GxWSUv-WG618g__original/img/Z4JjqVsHYm3AGxBRC2Ld1bScKuc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2009623.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2014,"publisher":"Decision Games (I)","designer":"Joe Youst","artist":"Joe Youst","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5,6,null],"avgRating":8.19695,"avgWeight":4.7},{"bggId":156061,"name":"Imperialism: Road to Domination","description":"Imperialism: Road to Domination approximately covers the period from the 15th to the 19th century.

Because being at war is expensive, it is often wiser to resort to plots and lies. Sometimes, making empty promises at the negotiating tables is better than getting involved in a risky and exhausting war, which may empty the treasury and expose you to losing precious prestige. The players have to pay extra attention to the dissenters who, especially in the beginning of the game, have greater military power and will not hesitate to draw others into a religious war. Will you manage to create an enormous colonial empire, military European dominion, or a territorially small but economically strong country? The players&rsquo; choices, luck, and reactions of others will affect the struggle. Creating an empire requires good strategic sense and a flexible approach to changing military and economic situations. The players have to forge thoughtful alliances and avoid wars which they may not win.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to create the most powerful empire.

A war started, and an alliance between different Natives groups factions successfully drove the invaders from their land and destroyed the city.<br/><br/>Almost fifty years later, Juan de Garay led a new expedition and founded a new city in the same area with the name of Ciudad de Trinidad. This city flourished to become modern Buenos Aires. Just like the first attempt, resources are low and the Natives, aware of the danger represented by the Spaniards, are ready to combat the intruders. To add to this tension, the English Crown has paid various Corsairs to threaten the new Spanish settlement!<br/><br/>In Trinidad players represent the heads of the Spanish families in Buenos Aires. The game is set in 1580 and covers the following 120 years, allowing the players to develop the city how they think is better. They can promote commerce with Spain, constructing a Harbor, and creating many productive buildings, or in another way, they can promote the construction of the biggest city buildings like the Cathedral, the Fort or the Cabildo. They can chase the richness, try to build an army or try to collaborate with the Church. They can link their policy to some famous city character, which will push a specific skill. But also this decision will not be easy! Some city representatives want to exploit all available resources and do a new war with Natives. Others push to collaborate with them, try to join forces and combat with the Corsairs.

To play one card, you discard others. (Like Race for the Galaxy) These cards can be very powerful, but they can also be stolen by spies. The whole landscape of the game can change in the blink of an eye as ownership of a card changes hands. Get one of your spies into a rival's castle, and you can take over his improvements or turn his own followers against him.<br/><br/>All interrupting effects have been stripped out of the game, so each player can complete their turn quickly, without waiting for the others. The game has been designed from the start to allow timed play, like a tournament chess match. This is good for players who want extra-brisk play, or who just have one slowpoke at the table who needs to be reined in.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LDJzQcmbj0NlWBIaBkVmAA__thumb/img/cKGkybcA8Z6Mr26xrkt0MgdtuGQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1411609.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LDJzQcmbj0NlWBIaBkVmAA__original/img/6uWEdfIIycJ8s_TweaL3mJQP0JE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1411609.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Thornhenge","designer":"Sam Brown","artist":"Allan Amato, Tomasz Jedruszek, Marek Madej","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":6.75018,"avgWeight":3.6818},{"bggId":1879,"name":"Arena: Morituri te salutant","description":"Tactical combat game, where you choose one or two characters, who fight each other (it's also possible with a multi-player variant, where some players can cooperate to win).

Each mission you choose will lead to different developments of the story and to plenty of unique opportunities like crafting options, unique items and rare hunts to be played.

Each monster is a unique challenge that hunters will have to face as a group, completing specific objectives and adopting different strategies.

With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 &mdash; heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler.

The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont&eacute;limar. They were to hold until relieved.

From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant&rsquo;s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.<br/><br/>Historically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this &lsquo;victory&rsquo; cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.<br/><br/>As Abraham Lincoln quipped, &ldquo;Mr. Early, you are late.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early&rsquo;s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn&rsquo;t solve it &ndash; can you?<br/><br/>To Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.<br/><br/>The Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years.

In the Dawn phase, each player uses their actions to move about, purify corruption, scout challenges, and share items. In the Challenge phase, each player undertakes a challenge. If they succeed, they gain rewards; if they fail, they incur penalties. In the Dusk phase, game upkeep is performed.<br/><br/>In order to win the game, the players must choose one warrior to enter Darkness as their champion. While the champion battles inside Darkness and attempts to reach the swallowed sun, the other warriors must still defend Tallil from the encroaching shadows, lest they corrupt the world and plunge everything into eternal night. If Darkness finishes swallowing the sun, or the shadows gain too much influence in the world, then the players lose the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nfY_S6QUSs605KY_j4Iagw__thumb/img/wW5NIj20rp3X_NWITy_mYu8djlM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2583948.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nfY_S6QUSs605KY_j4Iagw__original/img/u6AMFipa0soJJvCYRXnbNJQW2DE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2583948.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Wyrd Miniatures","designer":"Mason Crawford, Aaron Darland, Justin Gibbs, David Hanold, Kevin Wilson","artist":"Hardy Fowler, Jorge Gomez, Maria Leal","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.58626,"avgWeight":3.1111},{"bggId":337853,"name":"Angel Fury","description":"Welcome to the world of the unseen!<br/><br/>Armies of angels and demons clash in an epic battle over a human soul.

The major varieties of Preference are Croatian, Austrian, and Russian and there are variations of each as well.  Generally a three player game, a fourth player can play by having the dealer of each hand sit out for the round.

Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the &quot;talon&quot; and discards two, and then must take 6 tricks to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and &quot;kontra&quot; may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be &quot;rekontra&quot; and &quot;sukontra&quot; or doubled and doubled again and again!).<br/><br/>The players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.

The vast majority of Austrians cheer the Anschluss of their country by the German Reich. Central Europe is falling into Nazi hands and all the best European scientists will soon compete under the aegis of Heinrich Himmler, for whom no scheme is too wild or too improbable &mdash; but which team has the imagination, the courage, and the drive to most successfully accomplish their goals?<br/><br/>Secret Weapons of the Third Reich is a game for one to four players simulating the arms race of World War II from the German perspective. From secret submarine bases in Greenland to the mysterious Base 211 in Neuschwabenland, Antarctica, this game recreates the incredible tales of Nazi technology, from the famous V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets to the unlikely flying saucers derived from the work of Nikola Tesla. Will players be able to deliver the Haunebu project to completion? Will Hans Kammler escape with his last battalion of flying saucers to the dark side of the moon? Will the secret submarine fleet sail to Antarctica to pursue the war after the war? Or could German scientists produce an atomic bomb to be dropped on New York by an electro-gravitational flying saucer or within the warhead of a futuristic intercontinental V-3? Would it even be possible to build a huge solar satellite gun to strike America?<br/><br/>In the game, each player controls one or more research groups, each working on a secret weapon project. Each research group has a leading researcher, who provides an initial bonus (expressed in resource cubes or scientist cylinders) when the project is assigned. The researcher has a regime loyalty value that measures both the ability to make requisition attempts and the ability to resist opposing attempts.<br/><br/>A player tries to get their projects approved, then completed. Certain requirements (resource cubes and/or scientist cylinders and technologies attached to projects) must be met and costs paid in order to reach the stage of development of a project. Each turn, approved projects generate specific amounts of resource cubes as funding. Completed projects award victory points (VP) and allow, in most cases, weapon production. Produced weapons award VP to the owning player in addition to helping to achieve a cooperative goal for all players. In fact, if together the players fail to reach a certain number of weapons produced by the end of the game, they all lose. The weapon production goal varies depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>Play begins in 1938, one year before the outbreak of world war. At the start, players can only place research groups for their approved projects (project plants) in the portion of the map representing Germany and Austria. In 1939 and later, the conquests of Nazi Germany allow players to deploy their project plants in occupied European territories &mdash; but players will have to pay attention to the various locations because some areas allow only research and development, others only weapon production, and still others only research and development for U-Boat projects.<br/><br/>Also, players must operate in a &quot;state of warfare&quot;. This means that as time goes on they are more and more subject to enemy bombardments that can cause a great loss of resources and technologies. In addition, as starting in 1943 Allied and Soviet advances on Berlin make the map progressively smaller, players must face logistical issues never encountered during the early years of the war.<br/><br/>Should a completed project or produced weapon fall into Allied hands, players not only lose VP, but the weapons production goal recedes as well! Thus a certain amount of player cooperation is a must. Each player must balance his personal interests with the common need to share technologies and resources in order to fulfill the common goal.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, via events one player may secretly become the turncoat, working in the shadows to help the enemy, and winning the game if all players would otherwise lose.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zvLRlk1YxIyXOyuuKBq76w__thumb/img/p9jvb4AVkKQ99oaijBSJ8q9hGkk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3165758.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zvLRlk1YxIyXOyuuKBq76w__original/img/gFrkC9bZZ3WTtUYS1uDZeBoNYhA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3165758.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"4Dados","designer":"Luca Cammisa","artist":"Luca Cammisa","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3],"avgRating":6.89566,"avgWeight":4.3333},{"bggId":189506,"name":"Fallen Angel","description":"<a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asteriagames/fallen-angel-0/description?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asteriagames/fallen-ang...</a><br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FallenAngelTheBoardGame/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/FallenAngelTheBoardGame/</a><br/><br/>Fallen Angel is a game integrating dice-worker placement and area-majority scoring as its core mechanism, seamlessly matched with a steampunk fantasy theme.<br/><br/>The game is played in four rounds.

The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer François-Stanislas Thomas.<br/><br/>Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.<br/><br/>The game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.<br/><br/>Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the &lsquo;chaos of war&rsquo;, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck.

As a result, it became possible to produce wines of superior quality, particularly in white wines made from black grape varieties. While Dom Pierre P&eacute;rignon initially felt the sparkling of the wine was a negative feature, the consequent increase in both quality and quantity created the path that lead to the appreciation and recognition of champagne.<br/><br/>Throughout the 18th century, several &quot;champagne houses&quot; &mdash; or Champagne Maisons &mdash; were founded, and a new business dynamic grew in the region. These houses replaced small farm and monastery production in leading the evolutionary process of champagne, and by planting more vineyards or buying grapes from other producers or both, they mastered the specialization. To promote their product, the houses hired sales agents to take samples of their champagne wines to the Royal Courts of Europe, a crucial factor in generating the glamorous fashion of drinking champagne.<br/><br/>Despite production growth, improved quality, and increasing popularity, trade did not reach spectacular rates during the 19th century &mdash; which is why the game Dom Pierre is much more about winning prestige than earning money. In the game, you are responsible for one of the oldest Champagne Maisons, producing and selling wine all over Europe, not to mention the other side of the Atlantic. The local economy will be boosted, employment increased, and your brand will become universally recognized.<br/><br/>To make all this happen will require a chain of actions that starts in your vineyard. You will need to look for continuous improvement, constantly react to your opponents, and optimize your choices to build the most prestigious Champagne Maison. In game terms, on a turn you move up a disc on the winery game board and perform an action, with the actions become more powerful as the game progresses. You will plant in the vineyards, harvest crops, buy grapes from neighbors, make wines in your cellar (some more valuable than others), allocate salespeople on four market routes and workers in the vineyard and cellar, and acquire the necessary accessories to improve production.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d3vU53R_f2vmDvVQYRtZbA__thumb/img/SB3uQEfk-g6xglf6qG_4IKWr2I4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6850641.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d3vU53R_f2vmDvVQYRtZbA__original/img/D-Erjsu8k6XGPKLHJzstIZK0Vs0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6850641.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Pile Up Games","designer":"Costa, Rôla","artist":"James Churchill, Olivier Fagnère","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2],"avgRating":7.12122,"avgWeight":3.8},{"bggId":288798,"name":"Kings of War (Third Edition)","description":"This hardback tome contains all of the rules you&rsquo;ll need to fight epic battles across the tabletop, an extensive background section covering the races of Pannithor and their history, and full rules and army lists for 14 different factions.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0BPlMLWmbMIWTj_WgoxIOg__thumb/img/ma3DyVS3uw8RRV7BjSNBmuthy7Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5059258.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0BPlMLWmbMIWTj_WgoxIOg__original/img/cajp8WkoDqF2-SimgIDmJTADzsc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5059258.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":99,"yearPublished":2019,"publisher":"Mantic Games","designer":"Matthew James, Chris Morris (III)","artist":"Jose David Lanza Cebrian, Ciaran Morris","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[3,4,6],"avgRating":8.71282,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":281676,"name":"Galactic Era","description":"Galactic Era is an epic space strategy board game with a focus on exploration, expansion and combat.<br/><br/>The most innovative feature of the game is that you can choose to play as the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; or the &ldquo;light&rdquo; side with the appropriate consequences.

Players take on the roles of China, the United States, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  They simulate current political tensions through card play and structured negotiation keyed to real world events in an effort to &quot;move the needle&quot; to their side.  Unfortunately, the cards with the greatest chance of moving that needle, such as Chinese Coast Guard and U.S. Freedom of Navigation Exercise, are also most likely to trigger armed conflict.  If and when that happens, play transitions to traditional hex-and-counter format on a map scaled at 45 nautical miles (nmi) per hex and turns of 3-7 hours.<br/><br/>SCS is derived from Breaking the Chains (BtC), but is definitely a different game.  How do the two differ?  SCS begins with political turns that can lead to victory without armed conflict.  For armed conflict, SCS focuses more closely on the South China Sea (45 nmi per hex) rather than the larger southeast Asian region of BtC (70 nmi per hex) and uses smaller units such as air squadrons, ship pairs, and land battalions.  Therefore, the SCS map shows more detail, but less territory.  SCS employs streamlined versions of BtC's turn structure and strike mechanisms that expedite play by dispensing with numerous cycles and strike paths.  SCS nodded to ergonomics by putting all scores on one side of each counter &ndash; less flipping.  Most important, SCS allows naval units to move more than one hex in a single turn, but includes a mechanism, based on stealth, that enables the other side to &quot;check&quot; multi-hex moves to create a more dynamic, variable, and volatile environment.  This last adjustment allows quick moves at a distance, but prevents close-in ships from &quot;jumping&quot; through the beaten zone of modern anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), 290 nmi in some cases.

It is a corps-level simulation of the battle in Europe during World War II.<br/><br/>Advanced ETO is much more than just another World War II strategy game; Advanced ETO is an accurate simulation of the war in Europe, with historically accurate forces and combat units! All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.<br/><br/>Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe. As such, Advanced ETO contains almost twice as many pieces as the original ETO (over 2200!), including new mechanized, mountain, commando and cavalry units, additional naval and aircraft types, more Generals and even Admirals. For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 &quot;Black Widow,&quot; the Fw 200 &quot;Condor,&quot; Yak-9, Bloch 174, &quot;Defiant&quot; and many, many more.<br/><br/>And that's not all!<br/><br/>Advanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here. Best of all, Advanced ETO can be played as an exciting grand strategic game (from the beginning of the war to the end), or as one of the many quick campaigns or scenarios.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VRPeqc3Wi3Pi6h6bEmS_dA__thumb/img/aAp33KR87ui2OVCwLW_Li_VdZhk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic40320.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VRPeqc3Wi3Pi6h6bEmS_dA__original/img/hhfJmozISDpEOY3YIXQIUGYzJSk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic40320.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2001,"publisher":"Decision Games (I)","designer":"Eric R.

During the game, the players have a team of heroes with which they will fight against an ever increasing amount of powerful enemies. As a general rule, the game has a duration of five rounds, with one wave per player each round. Each wave is divided in four phases:<br/><br/>1. Lord Morth's phase: The starting player rolls the enemy dice into the portal board to determine in which path the enemies enter the boards. To do this, the player rolls as many enemy dice as indicated on the turn track, and a 12-sided die to determine the exact position of the portal. Also, the players receive cards to trump their opponent's strategies.<br/><br/>2. Portal phase: The players may pay gold to turn the portal, modifying the initial enemy distribution. In turn order, each player may pay as much gold as they want to move the portal in any direction. Once all players have moved the portal or have passed their turn, they take the enemy dice that ended the phase in their zones of the portal board, placing them in the corresponding paths.<br/><br/>3. Heroes' phase: Players move and attack with their team of characters, trying to eliminate all threats from their boards.<br/><br/>4. Assault phase: Enemies advance, trying to exit the player's boards. The starting player rolls a three-sided die, and each player has to add the resulting number to the initial movement value of each enemy. If an enemy escapes a player's board, the player takes damage.<br/><br/>Once all rounds are finished, the game ends and the player who has the fewest damage points wins!<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tvxmRZ0Fo-hJ6sySry3LuQ__thumb/img/qCPEJkKyB7BhqueoP6QLXxsgXUk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2593181.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tvxmRZ0Fo-hJ6sySry3LuQ__original/img/jqbBZHfW2RxvYvuahEpoUvEtMdw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2593181.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"ABBA Games","designer":"Buster Lehn, Manuel Muñoz, Fran Ruiz","artist":"Adrián Sanchez, Nicolas Serrano","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[1,2,4],"avgRating":6.69085,"avgWeight":3.125},{"bggId":320084,"name":"The Dogs of War","description":"&quot;The goal is to collapse adversary&rsquo;s system into confusion and disorder causing him to over and under react to activity that appears simultaneously menacing as well as ambiguous, chaotic, or misleading.&quot;<br/><br/>John R.

At the night of solstice, they brought an unexpected end upon the world, precisely by the rules they had foretold. Anything that people could imagine happened on that night. During that tragic spectacle, the Masters of Brilliance separated wheat from chaff, taking the chosen ones to a new nice little hell they had built in a higher dimension somewhere at the doorstep of afterlife. No one knows how they got there or how they managed to affect reality. Anyway, only rigorous cooperation could grant them enough power.<br/><br/>The end of the world brought about by these wise guys was not as perfect as they had planned. Soon it turned out that some men left in the ashes of the past world could enter the realm of the Masters of Brilliance. Perhaps the power they cast upon the world to destroy it left a solid print? Or perhaps the transition was not that difficult?<br/><br/>The first man to discover he possessed this ability was Jonas Arvani. When he found out he was not the only one, he founded a guild. The boarding ability &ndash; that is, the ability to jump into a much higher plane, where the Masters of Brilliance have their twisted utopia &ndash; soon turned into an enormous business. Not everyone managed to follow the guild's strict rules. Therefore competitive undertakings began to appear that were less able and less honest. Now retrievers have been trained by guilds to steal inventions and devices from the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance. Those items become artifacts in the ruined world. The most valuable prizes are schematics that allow mankind to recreate lost devices, so that they can serve people again.<br/><br/>In the board game Enclave: Zakon Krańca Świata, each player starts with a retriever card along with the machine that boosts their boarding ability. During the game, which lasts six turns, players are allowed to:<br/><br/><br/>    Upgrade their retriever (mental and physical condition)<br/>    Upgrade their jump machine (sarcophagus and sesame)<br/>    Buy items to protect themselves from deadly traps in the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance<br/>    Buy medication needed to heal their mental damage and physical wounds<br/>    Boarding the enclave of the Masters of Brilliance to find valuable prizes and knowledge<br/>    Do the job for the &quot;Shepherd&quot; without any risk, but with fewer profits<br/>    Visit the oracle to peek at the future and gain initiative in the next turn<br/>    Use the character or location card on the path &quot;to the tree&quot;<br/><br/><br/>This path is the main way to victory, known as becoming &quot;the chosen of the Tree&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Dwunastu przyw&oacute;dc&oacute;w religijnych zwanych Mistrzami Blasku zyskało wielkie wpływy oraz mn&oacute;stwo wyznawc&oacute;w, aby w noc przesilenia niespodziewanie wywołać koniec świata dokładnie według przepowiedzianych przez siebie reguł.<br/><br/>Właściwie stało się wszystko, co tylko ludzie zdołali sobie wyobrazić. A podczas tego dramatycznego spektaklu Mistrzowie Blasku odsiewali ziarno od plew. Zabierali wybranych, żeby zbudować im nowe, miłe piekiełko w wyższym wymiarze. Gdzieś w takim przedsionku do zaświat&oacute;w. Nie wiadomo, jak zdołali się tam dostać ani jakim sposobem potrafili wpływać na rzeczywistość. W każdym razie odpowiednią moc mogli uzyskać wyłącznie dzięki ścisłej wsp&oacute;łpracy.<br/><br/>Koniec świata pan&oacute;w mądrali nie był tak perfekcyjny, jak można by się spodziewać. Wkr&oacute;tce okazało się, że niekt&oacute;rzy z ludzi pozostawionych własnemu losowi na zgliszczach minionego świata potrafią przenikać do rzeczywistości Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku. Może moc, kt&oacute;rą Mistrzowie Blasku tchnęli w świat, żeby go rozwalić, zostawiła jakiś trwały ślad? A może przejście po prostu nie jest takie trudne? Pierwszym człowiekiem, kt&oacute;ry odkrył u siebie te niezwykłe zdolności, był Jonas Arvani. Niedługo potem przekonał się, że nie jest jedyny i założył gildię.<br/><br/>Umiejętność dokonywania abordaży, to znaczy skok&oacute;w w wyższy wymiar, w kt&oacute;rym Mistrzowie Blasku zbudowali swoją kaleką utopię, stała się wkr&oacute;tce wielkim biznesem. Gildia miała twarde zasady, kt&oacute;rym nie każdy m&oacute;gł podołać. Zaczęły powstawać konkurencyjne ugrupowania, mniej sprawne i mniej uczciwe.<br/><br/>Zadaniem pozyskiwaczy czy też szkolonych w gildii grabieżc&oacute;w jest wykradanie z enklawy Mistrz&oacute;w Blasku wynalazk&oacute;w i urządzeń, kt&oacute;re w zrujnowanym świecie zyskiwały rangę artefakt&oacute;w.

Two to five players, with excellent solitaire suitability. <br/>&quot;Black Swan&quot; is a block wargame with over 200 combat units. A game turn is three months (a season) and there are several three-season Scenarios and two Campaigns (1939 and 1941).<br/><br/>When in 1939 Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland, few in Germany - and probably in the rest of Europe - believed that France and Great Britain would have declared war.<br/><br/>In the previous months Hitler had broken the Treaty of Versailles, by which the harsh conditions imposed had humiliated and starved the German population for years and led to a political reunification of the original German Reich: restored the Rhineland, annexed Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, with the tacit consent of the other nations, Great Britain and France above all.<br/><br/>So his assumption that he could have done the same with Poland had a logical basis. Instead this time events went another way. <br/>Most European countries had been so devastated by WWI that few wanted another war. Ignoring the German preparations for a renewed war of revenge based on the new Blitzkrieg tactics, France developed an old fashioned concept of static border fortifications - the Maginot Line - and Chamberlain's Great Britain focused entirely on diplomacy in an attempt to deal in a gentlemen fashion with the rapacious and very ungentlemanly Nazi regime.<br/><br/>Even after the fall of France, which surrendered in a few weeks after a blitz attack across the Ardennes - almost the same move adopted at the beginning of WWI - Great Britain still tried to reach an agreement with Hitler.<br/><br/>This did not happen and Great Britain remained alone, with no American help, and was on the edge of the defeat, having to choose between an unfair peace or the threat of an invasion. It was only one man, the freshly appointed prime minister Winston Churchill - going against any logic and even against his own political peers and the Crown - that wanted to resist, and the outcome of the Battle of Britain later proved him right. <br/>However many months would have to pass before the Soviet Union first and the US later would join the Allied cause to restore peace in Europe, at the cost of millions of deaths....<br/><br/>As the Axis Powers you have to swiftly win the war, either by a Mediterranean strategy to break the British Empire, or an all out effort to demolish the Red Army. If a Decisive Victory is unobtainable, you can still go for a Strategic or at least an Economic Victory.<br/><br/>As the Allies, you must survive the initial onslaught and prepare for a long war of attrition before dealing a deathly blow to the Reich's body. <br/>I hope you will enjoy Black Swan, and that it will answer some of your questions as well.  I look forward to the conversations that will follow its release.<br/><br/>Historical Intro<br/>To strive in this world is to abide in the planes of chaos.<br/>Nowhere is this more readily apparent than in war. The belief in a cause, the assurance of a plan, the security of ordered ranks and painstaking calculation, all these are thrown into the hazard of conflict. Nothing ever survives.  Everything is changed.  In the aftermath, the world must always be rebuilt out of expediency and pretence.<br/><br/>Since antiquity, some have known this as &ldquo;The Black Swan.&rdquo;  It is the rare and unlooked-for event, something that is entirely unexpected and presages abrupt reversal.<br/><br/>In martial terms, The Black Swan symbolizes the unravelling of apparent certainty, together with man&rsquo;s desire to contrive notions of opportunity, or excuses for defeat, whenever he dares play with the volatile flames of ambition. Napoleon&rsquo;s fortune succumbed to this very phenomenon the moment his army moved against Russia. By the time of Waterloo, the great improviser of battlefield success had truly become the shifty and evasive apologist for disaster.<br/><br/>And then it was Hitler&rsquo;s turn.  Lying in a hospital bed come the end of The Great War, whose four year course was the embodiment of bold assertions gone awry, the infantry corporal simply could not accept the sudden and supposedly unforeseeable collapse of his beloved army.  What had gone wrong?  That army stood everywhere on enemy ground. Russia had succumbed and was occupied, and the French had been bled white.  It could only be betrayal - betrayal by communists and the craven factions in government.  These were his &ldquo;Men of 1918.&rdquo;  The German army had not been defeated.  The soldiers had simply been stabbed in the back.  And one a night in early 1933, as he stood on the podium in the packed Berlin Sportpalast, that is the story he told.  He would still be telling it twelve years later.<br/><br/>But the swan is no respecter of any cause or purpose.  Whatever things were, and whatever they become, the constant truth is, as Yeats put it: Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.  Whatever is gained or lost is not merely about having one good plan or a single bad one; rather, it is about what ensues when all plans inevitably founder.  Even if you cannot predict what is unpredictable, you should at least prepare for it the best you can. Men make plans to give order to chaos.  Whoever does that best will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qWBrZEhlMMJY6Q2_MYJxJA__thumb/img/DirPQO_EVnUOzi5_MOFG5ydgwyc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5462945.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qWBrZEhlMMJY6Q2_MYJxJA__original/img/P5tC6nv7DMs02Ky7cUcaZ2zwuFI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5462945.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2020,"publisher":"VentoNuovo Games","designer":"Emanuele Santandrea","artist":"Emanuele Santandrea","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3],"goodPlayers":[1,4,5,null],"avgRating":8.02535,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":319807,"name":"Shogun no Katana","description":"Feudal Japan, land of mystery, tradition, honor and sharp steel!

And this truly has to be an honorable man.<br/><br/>Basically this game is all about resource management and conflict, but unlike other games in this category you won't necessarily win, if you conquer the most areas. Your main goal is to earn enough honor, which can be achieved in different ways. There are two kinds of honor. 'Daimyo-Honor' is the victory condition and can be directly gained by holding provinces, and indirectly by transforming 'Samurai-Honor' at a set rate. 'Samurai-Honor' is gained by winning a defensive or offensive battle. It can be transformed into 'Daimyo-Honor' with a tea ceremony.<br/><br/>The first Daimyo who earns 50 points of honor wins the game. If this goal is not reached within 12 turns, the Daimyo with the most honor at that point wins the game.<br/><br/>What needs special mentioning is the turn mechanism of the game, which is really cleverly-devised: depending on the number of players, different 'offices' are in the game that get assigned to the players. In a 4-player game these offices are:<br/><br/>Daimyo: The active player. For clarification: in game terms, every player is a Daimyo, but only the active player acts as Daimyo. The Daimyo, as active player can restock his resources, attack a province and play special tiles. Most importantly, he assigns the other offices to his opponents.<br/><br/>Samurai: The general. He will lead the attack in the Daimyo's name. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful attack.<br/><br/>Bushi: the poor guy who is attacked by the Daimyo. He can earn 'Samurai-honor' with a successful defense.<br/><br/>Sensei: He gives council to the Daimyo. Tricky position, because his council can do the Daimyo harm or good. He can cancel an attack, spy on other players, use Ronin to destabilize a province, and suggest to the Daimyo how hard to punish his Samurai    when he loses a battle.<br/><br/>The battles are resolved by a system that depends on the number of troops and a rock-paper-scissors element. The opponents have the possibility to improve their odds by investing some of their resources.<br/><br/>The tricky part of the game is that most of your actions depend at least partly on the goodwill of one of your opponents. For instance the Daimyo depends on the Samurai to win, but the Samurai will only do this, if he sees enough gain for himself. This makes the game very interactive, with much discussion and haggling at the table.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjbKzH2GBqXw4aRZjXTTmg__thumb/img/RpNVp4WHSGgnUDJ0O3ij8ETbWU8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic376360.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjbKzH2GBqXw4aRZjXTTmg__original/img/XCXw2iw4rjGEBYA1XNDZzvBOUOA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic376360.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"Fantasy Flight Games","designer":"Michael Nietzer, Oliver Wolf","artist":"Hans-Jörg Brehm","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":6.21138,"avgWeight":3.6111},{"bggId":313807,"name":"Oros","description":"The Wise One, immortal keeper of wisdom and knowledge, has sent Demigods endowed with earth-moving power to the far reaches of humanity. In Oros each player acts as one of these Demigods. They must instruct their Followers in the wisdom of the mountains through study, worship, and experience. And only in the heights of the mountains can the greatest mysteries be known.<br/><br/>Oros is a tile-colliding, volcano erupting, mountain-making, wisdom-gathering, action-economy strategy game. On individual player mats, players move their Followers between action spaces, allowing them to manipulate a shared environment like a giant puzzle of plate tectonics. Action spaces allow players to shift rows of land, move and collide land tiles, form and erupt volcanoes, worship to gain wisdom, journey their Followers around the ever-shifting landscape, and build sacred places of study and worship on mountains. Building sacred places and worshipping in sacred places brings wisdom which is used to improve the abilities available for each action space. Wisdom is also used to improve the end game value of each sacred place built as well as reach other goals worth end game points.<br/><br/>When building sacred places, the Demigods of the Wise One ascend a ziggurat which acts as a timer toward the end of the game. When one reaches the top, players finish the round and then tally a final score.<br/><br/>At the core of Oros is the unique ability to shift, move, build up, erupt, and reposition the land within an infinitely connected play environment. This mechanic turns every action into a puzzle of creative problem solving, abstract thinking, and a constantly evolving strategy. Another chief aspect of the game is the player mat which uses a minimal worker placement mechanic to govern action opportunity. The mat also maintains an action economy that evolves differently for each player as they invest their gained wisdom into a variety of action improvements. Because of these core aspects, there are dozens of strategies for players to explore, and every game plays out in a different, yet competitive way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VTOAey9BsFvxUs3I1VlGIQ__thumb/img/MioGyOdhAx89WhQ-ujLvM4-Q6z0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7070031.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VTOAey9BsFvxUs3I1VlGIQ__original/img/yCNBnWRPJEAIuDPEcXXQd_-EbrA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7070031.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Aesc Games","designer":"Brandt Brinkerhoff","artist":"Brandt Brinkerhoff","honors":"2020 Ion Award Best Strategy Game Winner","bestPlayers":[3],"goodPlayers":[4],"avgRating":7.77804,"avgWeight":3.125},{"bggId":30795,"name":"Babylon 5: A Call to Arms – Second Edition","description":"The eagerly-awaited second edition of the award-winning A Call to Arms Babylon 5 space combat miniatures game is finally arriving.

In it, you take the part of an interstellar civilization competing to control a newly-discovered star cluster! Construct your empire, fight for resources, and research technology. Each alien species has its own unique flaws and advantages, and victory lies in recognizing this. The game is physically attractive, and includes well over one hundred figures of spaceships, starbases, colonies, alien citizens, and so forth. It takes place in a star cluster built up of individual pieces that changes every time you play.<br/><br/>The base game has four different alien civs from which to choose, but various expansions and add-ons increase this to 25 total alien Civs (one of which is secret, to be revealed during the Kickstarter campaign). The game does not have any sort of upkeep or victory phase. Instead, when it is a player's turn, they perform three actions, then play passes to the next player. This continues around and around until the game ends, by accumulation of victory points. Most actions cost metal or atomic resources, and include moving, building, research, combat, salvage, production, and so forth.<br/><br/>As with other Petersen Games products, the game is highly asymmetrical, and the various civilizations have unique abilities, homeworlds, weaknesses, super-units, and super-technologies.<br/><br/>Driving the strategy are a player's need to advance along the victory tracks. These permit players to score points by advancing along Probe, Research, Industry, and Battle tracks (representing exploration, experimentation, expansion, and extermination).<br/><br/>The base game supports 2-4 players, but with expansions the game can support up to six players. Unlike many multiplayer games, the game is balanced and works just as well with 2-3 players as it does with 4-6.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w6v348SDw8b-KAp2iJ3LTg__thumb/img/BEzhc-ejUafvanS1Zi55N1oE2Oo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4534625.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w6v348SDw8b-KAp2iJ3LTg__original/img/OVz9hGWZfIU--2P6193RnAddWDI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4534625.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Petersen Games","designer":"Sandy Petersen","artist":"Kent Hamilton","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.52174,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":168512,"name":"X-Men: Mutant Revolution","description":"In the aftermath of the Phoenix event, new mutants are appearing all over the earth.

For the next four years, Allied task forces engaged elements of the Imperial Japanese fleet throughout the ocean. Marines and army units began their program of island-hopping, wresting from the Japanese the empire that they had expanded in every direction.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific is a multi-level simulation of the Pacific theater of operations during World War II. The game enables players to recreate the entire course of the war with the US, from the opening Japanese attack on 7 December, 1941 to the climatic Allied assaults in the closing days of 1945. Representing some 30% of the globe, the strategic maps let players move and engage in combat on all levels: air, ground and naval. War in the Pacific is not a simple game; there are a number of rules and concepts that will, at first, be unfamiliar to a majority of players. But playing through smaller map sections and scenarios enables the player to become familiar with the mechanics of the game.<br/><br/>This is a reprint edition which substantially expanded the original's components.  Components: 7 full size (22 x 34&quot;) strategic maps in full color, new tactical maps with nearly 338 individual islands for new ground units to fight over, 32 die-cut counter sheets, nearly 9,000 counters showing all types of units from the Pacific Theater, rule books, chart books and assorted displays and player aid charts.<br/><br/>The rules have undergone significant change with greatly increased emphasis on detail  in combat while removing the detailed logistics system that was the focus of the old game and replacing it with a command point system modeled after Victory Games' &quot;Pacific War.&quot;<br/><br/>The order of battle is significantly more detailed. Leaders on many levels (and whose combat performance may be unpredictable), often serve to limit players' ability to affect the outcome of every battle to the Nth degree. A player's assignment of the right task force commander (for the right force at the right time), may spell the difference between a tactical victory and defeat.<br/><br/>The ground combat system has been completely revised, substituting a step-loss system adapted from VG's &quot;Pacific War.&quot; Pitched battles on islands and atolls are now resolved, including maneuver, on expanded tactical maps in six different scales, rather than simply being abstractly represented in a single hex on the strategic maps.<br/><br/>War in the Pacific's original air and naval systems are retained, in their essence, albeit with substantial modifications and above all added chrome in combat. Thus the game still feels like the original in those two aspects.<br/><br/>The game comes with the grand campaign and some small introductory battle scenarios.<br/><br/>Booklets:<br/><br/>    Rulebook I (rule 1.0 to 25.0)<br/>    Rulebook II (rule 26.0 to 62.0)<br/>    Scenarios &amp; Campaign reinforcements<br/>    Examples of Play, Optional Rules &amp; Designer's Notes<br/>    Chartbook I<br/>    Chartbook II<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ovV4lF-Sc5dWBKaIzWV5Wg__thumb/img/Xe-SL6Y7JW-yeGy0I4lfeQ8R2TY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic124607.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ovV4lF-Sc5dWBKaIzWV5Wg__original/img/FwrdtORDGCKPZpTUes7tEvdacCk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic124607.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2006,"publisher":"Decision Games (I)","designer":"Kevin Kiff","artist":"Tom Willcockson","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,6,null],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5],"avgRating":7.63448,"avgWeight":4.7857},{"bggId":188124,"name":"Ostroleka 26 maja 1831","description":"Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 covers the battle of Ostrołęka, one of the largest engagements of Poland&rsquo;s November Uprising. It was fought between Polish army commanded by general Jan Skrzynecki and Russian army commanded by field marshal Ivan Diebitsch. The battle was the final part of the operation of Polish army against Russian Imperial Guard. The meeting near Ostrołęka was a bit suprising for both sides, especially for Poles who didn&rsquo;t expect such quick appearance of Russian forces near their positions. Polish army was divided into two parts. The first part was situated on the eastern bank of the river Narew. The second, larger part was put on the western bank of the river. In Ostrołęka there were two bridges connecting both banks of the river (one of them was pontoon bridge).<br/><br/>The first part of the battle was fought on the eastern bank of Narew. Polish forces tried to slow down an assault of Russians and withdraw to the western bank. Unfortunately, in consequence of earlier orders, one of Polish infantry brigades commanded by general Bogusławski was stayed to defend town Ostrołęka (situated on the eastern bank of the river), and there attacked by overwhelming Russians and partially routed, partially destroyed. Russians took control over Ostrołęka at noon. Then some Russian grenadier battalions decided to cross the river through the bridges to create a bridgehead for further operations. So started the second part of the battle. Polish main army began attacks to destroy Russian bridgehead and both brigdes to prevent main body of Russian army to cross the river. There were few attacks. At first they were not properly coordinated. Russian small forces on the bridgehead was supported by powerful artillery situated on the eastern bank of the river which was higher than western bank and allowed crossing fire (Russians formed two great batteries, one to the north and one to the south of Ostrołęka, and were shooting over own units on the western bank).<br/><br/>In the later afternoon Polish attacks became more coordinated. Russians tried to gain more terrain, but it moved them out of the range of their supporting artillery and encouraged Polish army to make last, most powerful attack, which was stopped near to the river. The battle ended a famous charge of Polish horse artillery battery commanded by lt. col. J. Bem, which caused great chaos in the Russian forces and discouraged Russians to make general cavalry attack on Polish army in the end of the battle as they were used to do in the Napoleonic Wars. When battle ended, both sides had similar casualties (about 6 000 killed, wounded etc.). The battle is considered Polish army defeat because it left the battlefield and during the night and the next day started retreat, not chased by Russians who first weren&rsquo;t sure they had won. The main effect of the battle for Poles was the fall of morale of soldiers and the upper command, which allowed Russians to take initiative in the later part of Polish-Russian War.<br/><br/>Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 contains three scenarios, with one made to introduce players to the system and two historical ones, showing both parts of the battlle. The game is quite complex, tending to show full spectrum of tactic of the Napoleonic and Post-Napoleonic period, but in reasonably easy way. Basic game mechanic is similar to Igo/Ugo movement, but with two phases of movement: for cavalry and infantry, and two combat phases: for cavalry and infantry. Horse artillery is generally attached to cavalry and foot artillery is attached to infantry. Additional rules offer another movement systems but rather designed for further battles based on this rules, not for that one. Rules offer many possible reaction activities for non-active player during opposite player phase. Another rules feature is an unique combat calculation system based on traditional odds ratio but originally modified. The rules focuse on simulating cooperation of three kinds of weapon (infantry, cavalry and artillery) on the battlefield and showing different formations (column, line, square, skirmish, buildings defense). The playing time varies depending on the scenario, from 2-3 hours to whole day. It also depends on the players &ndash; the longest scenario can be finished very quickly by autowin.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- One mapsheet 96 x 68 cm <br/>- Nine sheets of die-cut counters (978 counters totally, most of them are markers)<br/>- One sheet of additional counters<br/>- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)<br/>- Three dices (D6)<br/>- Six sheets with tables and player aids<br/>- One sheet with units tables (alternative way of marking units loses)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dYEBKjd4n6QFnw7L2f5AYQ__thumb/img/BXytuQA59ot9VctVBhSjVKZc9tM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760503.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dYEBKjd4n6QFnw7L2f5AYQ__original/img/uc8OYsubVWOfxtq5xeimSBQhbmw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2760503.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Instytut Wydawniczy Erica","designer":"Ryszard Kita","artist":"Anna Andrzejewska-Godecka, Szczepan Atroszko, Wojciech Dąbrowski","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4,null],"goodPlayers":[1,3],"avgRating":8.94706,"avgWeight":4.1818},{"bggId":240901,"name":"A Time for Trumpets: The Battle of the Bulge, December 1944","description":"&quot;A Time for Trumpets&quot; (ATFT) is a battalion level wargame of the Battle of the Bulge.

With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.<br/><br/>The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.<br/><br/>The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state.

Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.<br/><br/>The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.<br/><br/>The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  <br/>Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:<br/><br/>&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.<br/>&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army<br/>&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles <br/>&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.<br/>&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.<br/><br/>The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units.

Clobber till content.<br/><br/><br/>Wyrd City&mdash;where conflict lies in wait around every corner and the shadows are acrawl with mystery and adventure, where liberty wanes, government waxes, and a chosen few don capes and cowls to take their stand in a world gone Wyrd....<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game features 32 original Heroes (and/or villains, depending on your perspective) and several Crews of secondary characters, including Freedom Patrols, Liberty Bots, Diabloids, Arachnidrones, Darklings, thugs, and zombies. Each Hero is defined by personalized stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, and Vigor) and 3 unique Powers, while each Crew is defined by personalized stats and 1 unique Power. Altogether, Capes &amp; Cowls provides over 75 characters with over 100 Powers.<br/>    <br/>Capes &amp; Cowls is played on a unique Battleboard whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though certain game situations do require a roll of the Battle Die, skillful players will find themselves seldom relying on luck to determine the outcome of an action. In short, the player who recruits and manages his team of Heroes most wisely will nearly always prove the victor.<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls offers the following 3 modes of play:<br/><br/>1. Basic: In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of 2 or 3 Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and dukes it out with his opponent&rsquo;s team for a predetermined number of rounds. The victory goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>2. Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of 4 or 5 Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. The victory, as in the Basic Game, goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>3. Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.<br/><br/>In addition to the above modes of play, Capes &amp; Cowls also allows for solitaire and multiplayer variations.<br/><br/>Wyrd City&mdash;where the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; are bad, the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are you, and the dress code is decidedly unusual.<br/><br/>Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game!

Mechanically, Soul of the Empire uses dice-driven action selection, deterministic combat with faction effects, culturally-based Power decks, and an objective point system to heighten tension between the factions. Thematically, Soul of the Empire explores the tensions between and motivations behind the four dominant worldviews of the period. Rome is at the height of it&rsquo;s power, but is overextended in the face of both internal divisions and external challengers. Jews zealously protect their spiritual heritage from a rapidly spreading sect, and chafe under the thumb of an increasingly oppressive Rome. The Coalition struggles to survive beset by relentless Roman expansion, harsh environments, and confusing beliefs which threaten the old ways.

The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.<br/><br/>Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.<br/><br/>Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.<br/><br/>Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.<br/><br/>(source: Legion Games website)<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aFilOR8T8scff45ypyDcpA__thumb/img/INL2Lj3UOm--rRNVsbHTDsbibdk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2002153.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aFilOR8T8scff45ypyDcpA__original/img/Gg4uJ46XQLoldPVffleLYf959MM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2002153.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Legion Wargames LLC","designer":"Didier Rouy","artist":"Didier Rouy","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":7.80299,"avgWeight":3.1667},{"bggId":314125,"name":"Factory 42","description":"Factory 42 is a Euro-style board game for 2-5 players. The game tells the story of the workweek of Marxistic dwarves in a steampunk industrial setting, placing the player in the role of factory Overseers. It combines worker placement and a cube tower to create a resource management puzzle. Factory 42 is a cutthroat competitive game with elements of co-operation and deals involving Economics, Fantasy, Industry and Negotiation with a pinch of satire, but not too much to make it a Humor game. It satisfyingly blends two-fold tensions: camaraderie forged in shared goals, and the opportunistic trampling of temporary competition. A tight game of glancing blows and communal glory creating a wicked blend of sharp elbows and shared ambition. Visually, Factory 42 takes its influence from 1920&rsquo;s Soviet Union propaganda, fantasy literature and elements of pre-WWI Prussian decor.<br/><br/>The general process control at Factory 42 is as follows: <br/><br/>         Receive work orders/requisitions from the government<br/>         Receive some of the requisitioned resources (as determined by the cube tower)<br/>         Load resources (and spike additional resources) onto railcars<br/>         Transfer the railcars to docks at individual manufacturing facilities<br/>         Burn leftover resources to generate steam<br/>         Trade resources on the open market<br/>         Use steam and resources to manufacture requested items.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Capricious Bureaucracy:* Resources made available to all players, making up a common pool, are delivered via the Bureaucracy Tower; a mechanic that can deliver or withhold resources in a random manner. This replicates the notion that &ldquo;the powers that be&rdquo; redirect funds/resources by tying them up in red tape, trapping resources that would otherwise normally be available for the general populace. What goes into the tower does not always come out, or may have been held up during some unknown bureaucratic process, to later materialize when least expected<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Requisition:* Tactical decisions start with the acquisition of resources vital to the production process. The order of worker meeples on the requisition line dictates the volume of resources acquired for the common pool (available to all) and the number that can be obtained and stored in a player&rsquo;s personal warehouse. Choices made here can benefit a player&rsquo;s future actions but may also unwittingly aid a rival, making each choice so very important.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Loading:* Players can tactically direct their workers to the loading bays where resources are loaded onto lines of rail transport. Order here can be extremely vital to one&rsquo;s success. Misjudging the order (or cunningly foreseeing the future) may lead a player to have to load a cart for a rival rather than for one&rsquo;s self. Alliances may be made during this process, just as enemies can be made of rivals, depending on choices made when loading<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Shipping and Storage:* Once loaded, each rail cart proceeds to the shipping location awaiting direction. Workers have the option of forwarding on the loaded carts to player&rsquo;s docks. Once more order of placement is paramount as carts are only shipped in order. A cart may not contain useful resources and so could be sent to a rival, taking up valuable storage space, or maybe it will benefit a rival in an attempt to build a verbally agreed alliance. Often a cart has been loaded with a wide variety of resources and only part of this precious load is of use. Limited storage space in player&rsquo;s personal docks and warehouses dictates the shipping decision-making process as much as a rival&rsquo;s needs<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Trade and Research:* Commodities may be traded on an ever changing market, often enabling an unnecessary resource to be exchanged at a price, for something of more use. Research is equally important, allowing players to expand storage facilities, improve  material handling in the manufacturing process or even learn how to use Invention cards to add special actions/abilities during play<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Manufacture and Accounting:* The government dictate what should...no, what must be manufactured during a game round. The government orders must be completed or many, sometimes all players suffer sanctions. A degree of cooperation is needed here for the greater good of Dwarven society, but on an individual level, completion of a government order leads to reward and ultimately progression on the path to victory<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-uwifK436Y9z6oCHwP-BxA__thumb/img/whROe3682JtbiAIkV2wC1G2YBYM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6929909.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-uwifK436Y9z6oCHwP-BxA__original/img/uuhM6KRKaWXAQSVxoprH1TNN98c=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6929909.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Dragon Dawn Productions","designer":"Timo Multamäki","artist":"Lars Munck","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[5],"goodPlayers":[3,4],"avgRating":6.81959,"avgWeight":3.7778},{"bggId":202265,"name":"Chicago & NorthWestern","description":"American Robber Barons look to exploit America's midwest in this collusive game of explosive railroad expansion in the late 1800s.

The result: a salient into German territory that lacked only the last objective, and was thus a tragic defeat.<br/><br/>The 2,000-plus counters detail Brereton's Airborne Corps of three divisions, the units of Brian Horrocks's 30th Corps, and Model's scattered and dishevelled forces at company level for infantry; battery level for artillery, anti -tank and anti-air; and troop level for tank and armored cars.<br/><br/>The four maps cover the area from the front along the Meuse-Escaut Canal to the land, nearly 200 hexes away, surrounding the Arnhem Highway Bridge. Each map is positioned to cover the operational area of one airborne division. That allows one-division scenarios.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the interaction of two variables: fire power and morale. The structure of the game turns is simple, with each player turn divided into a Command Communications Phase and a Maneuver Phase.

Attacks proceed with a preliminary barrage, fire attack by maneuver companies, and then close action with tanks or assault troops. All activities involve comparisons of involved units' capabilities.

News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.<br/><br/>As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.<br/><br/>In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.<br/><br/>_____________<br/><br/>In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!<br/><br/>The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.<br/><br/>Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.<br/><br/>Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.<br/><br/>After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;<br/><br/>The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.<br/><br/>Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.<br/><br/>The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cKUoMYgdqzpWCk1tD6ih5w__thumb/img/mwSIy9WLBQr6ZXviQTQVmbOBkuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2318552.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cKUoMYgdqzpWCk1tD6ih5w__original/img/_3zEwCx-jtWhEYxuzC7MX2rOmYY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2318552.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"Jonathan Pac Cantin Games","designer":"Jonny Pac","artist":"Don Aguillo","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":7.29803,"avgWeight":3.5455},{"bggId":189351,"name":"Virus","description":"A frightening virus, Virus Q, is spreading in the major cities of the planet. Infected people and animals change rapidly, becoming horrible bloodthirsty and almost unstoppable creatures. Our only hope is to find the zero patient and the place where everything originated. There, perhaps, we can find an antidote and return the hope to the dying humanity.<br/><br/>But not everyone agrees. There are those who want to take advantage of the chaos and terror in order to gain power and establish a new form of government, trying to maneuver and control the monsters generated by the virus. A cure would ruin their plans forever.<br/><br/>The virus was created in a secret military lab, in a space that's practically inaccessible. Inside, Virus Q spread for the first time, accidentally, maybe; the creatures that now inhabit the Lab are difficult even to imagine...<br/><br/>In the innovative lab crawler game Virus, players are the team that infiltrates the Lab looking for the antidote to Virus Q. They will collect the few and fragmentary bits of information scattered in the laboratory, avoiding or fighting the monsters that populate it.<br/><br/>The map generation and the movement/placement of monsters depends on the player actions with a semi-automatic mechanism controlling what takes place where. The fighting requires some dexterity elements as well as players must plan their tactics by combining their shooting power with available movement, achieving successes by rolling cubes.<br/><br/>Also, the game takes place in real time!<br/><br/>In sum, you can play Virus cooperatively, semi-cooperatively or competitively.

Some won great fortunes in gold, while many others only died an early death. These men were The Conquistadors. In this partly card-driven, partly procedural game &mdash;a brand-new design from Jon Southard &mdash; one to five players each control a group of conquistadors, trying to discover and loot the civilizations of the Americas and end up with the most gold and power.<br/><br/>A game of The Conquistadors begins with the outline of Central and South America as known in 1520. Your first task will be to seek out and discover the great Indian cities and empires -- which may appear in their historical locations, or in quite different places. Once you discover where the cities and empires are, it is time to gather gold. You might battle and plunder the Indians, or your best plan may be to attempt diplomacy and enlist them as allies -- especially if you have an Indian interpreter in your expedition. Like Francisco Pizarro, you might try a Sudden Shock Attack to capture a native king and extort a fat ransom. Always you must be sure to keep the Governor happy, or he may issue a warrant for your arrest. Beware of native uprisings, painted warriors, and poisoned darts around the next corner, and watch out for defection in your own ranks. If you fall behind in the race for gold, you might try to descend the Amazon or discover the Fountain of Youth. And when you are really in a tight place, perhaps you can appeal to Mano de Dios (the Hand of God) to bail you out.<br/><br/>The Conquistadors is playable by from 1 to 5 players, with an introductory Basic Game, a more involved Standard Game, and some optional rules.

Additionally, each player has a deck of cards that could substantially help them achieve their goals.<br/><br/>The game plays over the course of four rounds with four turns per round. The &quot;game board&quot; consists of a 4x4 grid formed by the 16 region cards. After setup, one player reveals the top attack card. Afterwards the players determine the transformer effect. Now each player draws dice out of their bag (normally 5) and rolls them. Then, each player takes one action with one or more of their dice, until all players have used all of their dice.<br/><br/>Dice may be placed on a player&acute;s own player mat;<br/>To use an already built Public Building;<br/>To activate one of their own Player Cards; or<br/>To use an active Player Card<br/><br/>At the end of a turn the players have to defend themselves against the attack of the Circumdate Caelo Trust. After four turns a game round ends. Once the fourth round has ended, the game ends and the players add up their collected medals and victory points to determine the winner.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ghyUzXX4tMm480F7ZFICXg__thumb/img/-jvOBiSSa8GnbRqJhUODa7azvB0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5867382.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ghyUzXX4tMm480F7ZFICXg__original/img/Yo7IZNGRUz5Qg9ZPNMzHTdzHKwE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5867382.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"Spielworxx","designer":"Bernd Scholz","artist":"Harald Lieske","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[],"avgRating":6.52483,"avgWeight":3.125},{"bggId":300944,"name":"Gates of Mara","description":"Lead your tribe to the Gates of Mara, portals to realms of pure elemental energy.

Raicer, The Fall of the Third Reich covers the dramatic last two years of WWII in Europe, as the Western Allies and the Soviet Union fight against fierce German resistance to bring down the Thousand-Year Reich.<br/><br/>The time is July, 1943. From the beaches of Sicily to the plains of central Russia, millions of men are poised to decide the fate of Europe and bring about the end of WWII...<br/><br/>Two large hex maps cover Europe from France to Central Russia, and Leningrad to Sicily. Units are Armies, Corps, and in a few cases, Divisions. There are twelve two-month turns.<br/><br/>Those turns play quickly, and yet there is a lot of subtlety within each one, with rules for both reaction and exploitation. Getting the most out of the various movement segments is essential for both players: as the Axis for plugging gaps in the front line, and as the Allies for exploiting every last opportunity to move ever further into the Third Reich proper. But the German player will quickly learn that a passive defense is doomed to fail, and that selective counterattacks are vital to hold the enemy at bay.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for Soviet and German Command (Stavka), while the effects of Hitler's increasing interference in military affairs is presented through a rule which requires the German player to use OKW (West Front Headquarters) or OKH (East Front HQ) to be able to retreat infantry units from an enemy ZOC.<br/><br/>While the Soviets and Germans begin the game locked in a death struggle at Kursk, the Allies face the early dilemma of where to invade, with a choice of invasion sites ranging from Holland to Greece. Knock Italy out of the war or Second Front Now! in Northwest Europe: the choices are yours.<br/><br/>Supply rules have been kept as simple as possible, while still modeling the historic importance of logistics. The Western Allies in particular will learn the importance of ports in supplying their armies, and have to base their strategy around them.<br/><br/>Perhaps most significantly, the game effectively models the Strategic Air War over Europe with only a few simple rules and a handful of counters. But though easy to learn, this &lsquo;game within a game&rsquo; can have a dramatic impact upon the course of the war, as the Allies must prioritize their air resources while the Luftwaffe struggles both to slow the Allied air offensive and support the German armies in the field. The challenges are numerous and subtle.<br/><br/>Other rules cover variable (and degrading) German troop strength,  Allied Airborne drops, Strategic Transit, Forts, Yugoslav Partisans, and Axis Minor Powers, including Italian Surrender<br/><br/>The game can be played by two (Axis and Allied/Soviet) or three players (Axis, Allied and Soviet) but also works well solo. The Fall of the Third Reich is a game of large scope and nail-biting decisions, combining fidelity to history with a fun playable game system.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Product Information<br/>Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months<br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 30 miles<br/>Unit Scale: Armies, Corps and some Divisions<br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played well with 3 players or solitaire<br/>Playing Time: 6-10 hours<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/msxl3RTalmAdgj3PNSBC-w__thumb/img/UNYtvraX5PeY1WcgscWBYyB-PgE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3248854.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/msxl3RTalmAdgj3PNSBC-w__original/img/bjIrsyYvYzIo0BKKPHcXsFnooYI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3248854.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2016,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Ted Raicer","artist":"François Vander Meulen, Michael Monfront","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[1,null],"avgRating":7.79667,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":255512,"name":"The Ghosts Betwixt","description":"Young Richie has been kidnapped!

The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham. 1812 is set in North-East England in the 19th century. Two to four players represent investors in railway companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned Private and Minor Companies and later buying shares in Public Companies. The Public Companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its Director). Minor Companies and Public Companies build track and run Trains in order to earn revenues. Public Company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and Trains. A feature of 1812, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a Public Company&iacute;s Director and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.<br/><br/>1812 is a medium length game.

Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.<br/><br/>The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints.

It was a complex war that involved diverse interests and troops from many nations. Great Britain sent her troops to defend Portugal, within the context of the European Coalitions against France.  In Spain proper the war, which presented certain aspects of a civil war, saw an uneasy alliance of reformists and traditionalists under the name of &quot;Patriots&quot; facing the puppet King Jose I Bonaparte and the occupation army; composed mainly of French but also of Italians, Neapolitans, Poles, Germans, Swiss, Dutch and even Spaniards (known as &quot;Juramentados&quot;).<br/><br/>Spaniards, British and Portuguese form the Allied side while France and her allies and satellites form the Imperial side.

In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Players start off following some &quot;initial rule set&quot;, and gameplay occurs in clockwise order, with each player taking a turn. In that turn, they propose a change in rules that all the other players vote on, and then roll a die to determine the number of points they add to their score. If this rule change is passed, it comes into effect at the end of their round. Any rule can be changed with varying degrees of difficulty, including the core rules of the game itself. As such, the gameplay may quickly change.<br/><br/>Rules are divided up into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules (called transmuting) before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones. A rule change may be:<br/><br/><br/>     the addition of a new mutable rule<br/>     an amendment to a mutable rule<br/>     the repeal of a mutable rule<br/>     the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable<br/>     or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable<br/><br/><br/>The game can be played around a table with written notes, or online through mailing lists or forums.

They have been re-mastered and updated into all-new, super-sized editions. These were well regarded by many as balanced and thoughtful games. They cover fascinating, almost forgotten conflicts that would guide the course of WW II in the Mediterranean Theater.<br/><br/>Forgotten Legions is yet another Classic Reborn! by Compass Games.<br/><br/>Drive on Damascus givers you an operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (June and July) 1941 Allied invasion of Vichy French held Syria and Lebanon. Here you can hone your game play skills with open maneuvering on the desert side of the map and tough in-fighting on the mountain side. A fluid situation can develop as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. And along the coast players will probe for vulnerabilities by maneuver and infiltration. An exhaustive Order of Battle based on archival records helps capture key historical facets of the campaign including armor advantage, air power, ranged artillery, flotillas and commandos, garrisons, mountain units, untried units, and more. Also examined is the possibility of a German intervention<br/><br/>Bloody Keren presents an operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (January through April) 1941 campaign in Italian Eritrea that historically saw a climax at the mountain pass at Keren. Here too, good game play is at a premium as strategically you allocate your forces to various mountain passes. Both sides can attack and counter-attack while guerilla forces attempt to close off reinforcements coming from the south.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the 1981 and 1983 releases by World Wide Wargames (3W) that honor the original game designs. All aspects of the games have been enhanced &ndash; rules, charts and tables, map, counters &ndash; based on years of player experience and feedback. The rules are common to both games and are short and well illustrated, along with extensive Design Notes. Each game has a short scenario in addition to the Campaign scenario. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, each Campaign scenario can allow for up to four players (two per side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic designs by Vance von Borries. For your gaming enjoyment, this game has been super-sized by featuring a larger playing surface (two maps) and the larger 5/8&rdquo; counters to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/h7fJU2wtn1t2-I0vAEkPhA__thumb/img/0Y6QnVEEEAxR0ByqGuaCi-ApXIM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4211658.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/h7fJU2wtn1t2-I0vAEkPhA__original/img/SnHG4CEdcWCf9qFK8j8LYOlJZgc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4211658.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"Compass Games","designer":"Vance von Borries","artist":"Todd Davis, Knut Grünitz, Brien J.

Speed - but not reckless haste - is the key to success.<br/><br/>On 25th April 1915, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, launched a hastily assembled force of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops against the Turkish defenses on the Gallipoli peninsula. Their goal was to capture the forts that guarded the Dardanelles. With that achieved, the British and French Fleets would sail to Constantinople, topple the Ottoman government, and open up a supply line to Russia. However, defending the beaches was an equal number of Turkish divisions, hardened in the recent Balkan Wars, led by well-trained Turkish officers, supported by advisors from the German General Staff.<br/><br/>An hour before dawn, in complete silence, the Anzacs rowed ashore at Ari Burnu, a place later to be famous as Anzac Cove. The Royal Navy had landed them in the wrong place! Huge dirt cliffs and scrub-choked washouts confronted them, rather than a beach and low dunes. Nevertheless inland they went, overrunning the Turkish pickets, only to become hopelessly confused by the night landing, jigsaw terrain, and inexperience. Several miles inland, a gifted Turkish Officer, Mustafa Kemal, was reviewing his regiment after night maneuvers above Ari Burnu. Kemal's quick and furious counter-attack saved the day for the Ottomans, and set him on the path to become the founder of modern Turkey. Further south, at Cape Helles, the Lancashire Fusiliers won six Victoria Crosses - before breakfast - as they ripped through the barbed wire on the beach. The invaders never reached even their first day's objectives, although the Turks only avoided defeat by a hair's breadth. With a different plan, they might have thrown the invaders back into the sea.<br/><br/>The map scale is 400 metres per hex and covers the entire peninsula from north of Anzac Cove to Cape Helles, based on the 1922 British Ordnance Survey (i.e. from Anzac to Helles, including all the forts in between). Players can choose to land at the historical beaches, or create their own plans.<br/><br/>This wargame system emphasizes command and control. Players command by Brigade and Regiment. To be successful, a player must plan for the eventual exhaustion of their troops, rotating them out of line to rest and recover stragglers. The result is an accurate modeling of the tempo of these battles. Infantry combat is ranged rifle and MG fire, culminating in close assault. Artillery is powerful but ultimately limited. Shrapnel from the standard field guns is deadly against troops in the open, but only the rare howitzers firing high-angle HE can deal with trenches.  Daylight turns are two hours, night turns are four hours.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_uAO57N7Bs_yVKUcWLUC8Q__thumb/img/uhcNKxmxHeNS1f9bMQkNxRc0j1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4213571.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_uAO57N7Bs_yVKUcWLUC8Q__original/img/DMS7FF1G4g_mu0HGgdMpVqIZvxU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4213571.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2018,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Geoffrey Phipps","artist":"Rodger B.

Each of these components may add different effects and influence on quality of beer.<br/><br/>     Increase/decrease beer attributes  (aroma, color, taste)<br/>     Produce more or less bottle caps (market share)<br/>     Add extra points<br/><br/><br/>What ingredients we&rsquo;d use, thereby what effects in our beer we&rsquo;d get influence all game areas:<br/><br/>     Market (area control), represents what consumers expect from beer. Some prefer aromatic beer, some prefer to drink from bottles, other ones favor specific style (India Pale Ale, Bock, Pilsner). Players brew beer that meets several tastes thereby achieve points from different markets at the same time!<br/>     Beer Festival(bidding &amp; combo):  Here matters especially aroma, color, taste. These characteristics are assessed by the critic. He assign festival points and it&rsquo;s worth effort because only at the festival you can win rare brewing passion tiles!<br/>     Trends: In Beer Empire world there are few main beer trends (Pilsner, Bock, India Pale Ale, Lager and ALE). Brewing beer compatible to the trend gives you experience tile that opens new great possibilities for brewing!<br/><br/><br/>What is most important, it is up to you and your abilities of smart resource management (tile placement &amp; worker placement) and right recipes composing,  which direction you&rsquo;ll go. Would you accomplish goals in all fields or you&rsquo;d focus just on chosen elements?<br/>What we want to underline is that each of these elements influence on each other making every play one of a kind.<br/><br/>It seems it&rsquo;s gonna be a really hard work to build your Beer Empire.<br/><br/>(Espa&ntilde;ol)<br/><br/>Beer Empire es un juego competitivo para 2 a 4 jugadores que asumir&aacute;n el papel de due&ntilde;os de peque&ntilde;as cervecer&iacute;as que tendr&aacute;n que crear sus recetas, obtener recursos, ampliar su industria y construir su propio imperio de la Cerveza<br/><br/>Los jugadores se convierten en due&ntilde;os de peque&ntilde;as cervecer&iacute;as, aut&eacute;nticos entusiastas de la cerveza, que luchar&aacute;n ferozmente para hacerse con el mercado y competir por el reconocimiento de su habilidad artesana en los festivales de la cerveza.<br/><br/>Para poder conseguir sus metas, crear&aacute;n recetas de cervezas que elaborar&aacute;n asegur&aacute;ndose de que tenga los rasgos correctos.

Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?<br/><br/>Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.<br/><br/>Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a president&rsquo;s vital political support.

Many become disillusioned, discontent even, and turn to pirating the prosperous trade routes between the five planets, much to the regret of the colonies' leaders, who have great need of the trade income in order to advance technologies and create jobs for the newly-arrived colonists.<br/><br/>Colonies is a game of resource management in the far reaches of space in which the players compete to dominate in trade, politics and technological development. Each player controls the administration of a planet with access to a unique resource. In order to win you need to collect the most colonial credits by trading resources, upgrading your technologies, keeping your trade lanes free of pirates, and perhaps pushing the council's decisions in the right direction.<br/><br/>At the begining of each turn, players receive an income of their own resource. The council meets each turn to vote on how to handle an occurring event. The outcome can reward those willing to put in an effort or punish those who are not. Players may do well to form alliances in order to sway the vote in a favourable direction.<br/><br/>The resource income and the colonists that arrive each turn &ndash; sometimes in large numbers, sometimes in small &ndash; are used to make advances in five areas: Community, Military, Commerce, Influence and Industry. Following the council's vote, players take turns to either upgrade these areas or activate one of them to grant asylum to pirates in exchange for resources or hunt them for bounty, sell resources for Credits, make trade agreements more beneficial, or produce additional resources. When everyone has had three such actions, the players receive and pay resources according to the trade agreements, and any colonists that players have failed to employ turn to piracy, preventing players from getting income from their trade agreements next turn unless preemptive action is taken.<br/><br/>Colonies lasts ten turns, with players earning victory points (VPs) from colonial Credits and technology advances.

Each player has victory conditions determined by the scenario in which to defend or take objectives, seek and destroy their opponent&rsquo;s units, or one of many other different scenario objectives.<br/><br/>The game is played on an abstract map board made up of terrain cards in the game and managed through a distance system that accounts for the range to targets, line of sight, and defensive attributes. The player has units that start out on the map and gradually work their way towards their objectives by advancing through the battlefield all the while conducting combat actions against their opponent or defending their troops from return fire or whatever hell that awaits them. Players draw cards from a common action deck where they will play actions on their units on the map board. The game is an IGOUGO impulse system and turns are managed when the action deck is exhausted. (Some scenarios may require multiple deck exhaustion to finish the game). Actions in the game consist of Fire, Move, Assault, Rally, etc. The action cards contain dice icons on them to determine random results.<br/><br/>One of the unique features of the game is that it contains a deck of terrain cards that are not part of the action deck. As players change terrain they will draw a terrain card in which their moving units will occupy. Some action cards such as Recon helps players manage what terrain they occupy but your opponent may have other plans for your moving troops during their turn.<br/> Combat in the game is similar to how combat is conducted in Lock n Load Tactical. 2 players can play a game in about an hour (depending on the scenario size) and if you cannot find an opponent then try the game solo system. In general, the gameplay is fast and excited and compares to such legendary game systems as Up Front.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qhRvLWTB-GKBD-p7JHtHAg__thumb/img/TOXA2e-_nhXc_HLvQiOLeTnDstY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6979640.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qhRvLWTB-GKBD-p7JHtHAg__original/img/0LQKPJidys52-E9P_hx5B8XZJ7Y=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6979640.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC.","designer":"Sean Druelinger","artist":"Blackwell Hird, Shayne Logan","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,3,4],"goodPlayers":[null],"avgRating":8.41408,"avgWeight":3.5},{"bggId":130922,"name":"Blocks in Afrika","description":"BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a new concept game covering the whole North African campaign from 1940 to 1943.<br/><br/>Developed on wooden blocks and cubes system, over an astonishing 87x64cm full laminated multicolor map-board, there's not any paper component, but the Manual.<br/>All the over 400 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.<br/><br/>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/>On June 10 1940, the Italian Fascist Leader Benito Mussolini was convinced that it was the right time to join the war on the German side before it  was over and Germany got all the glory.<br/><br/>Fascist Italy was unprepared for a World War, but Mussolini thought the war would have only lasted for some weeks and that a few thousand Italian casualties would have given him some credibility at the future Peace Conference.<br/><br/>However, as soon as Italian troops crossed the French border, they encountered  fierce resistance  from the determined French Transalpine Army.<br/><br/>Even worse was to come when the Italian Army  crossed the Egyptian border to face a well trained and motivated British Desert Force;

Once those resources are extracted, the Beta Bots' task is to deliver them to the corporation's ships.<br/><br/>It won't be a piece of cake. To start with, the exoplanet is unstable, so the Beta Bots will have to adapt to a constantly changing environment.  On top of that, each corporation ship requires different resources, and each payload delivery requires perfect timing &amp; alignment with the orbiting trajectory of the matching ship. And last, but not least, the rival corporation Cylindroids INC&reg; has sent its own bots to snatch resources and interfere with your bots.<br/><br/>But do not fret! Beta Bots can count on Alpha Bot&rsquo;s help, a support robot with a (very) short-tempered AI. Alpha Bot will unlock new places to mine, give the Beta Bots more actions and generally make their life easier...but keep an eye on those pesky Cylindroid bots, since they won't pass up the opportunity to damage your guardian!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Mechanical overview:<br/><br/>The game is organized in rounds. In each round, an event takes place (which might involve trouble for the Beta Bots!) and the players will program actions to interact with the planet's resource-laden chambers, with enemies, with Alpha Bot, or with each other. Actions are chosen in secret and players commit to them before any are revealed. The stress level of each bot determines the turn order as well as its possible resource deliveries. Then players take turns to reveal their programmed actions, and execute them.<br/><br/>Each player has their own robot's blueprint, where they store resources using multiple containers of limited size. Those resources can be delivered to the passing ships, or they can be transformed or spent to enhance the robot's capabilities.<br/><br/>During the adventure, the autonomous Alpha Bot will advance through the planet's chambers until it reaches the surface. Players can interact with Alpha Bot to obtain advantages or to steer it out of harm's way, since it is vulnerable to enemy attacks and the planet's adversities.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, there's a maintenance step that includes the activation of enemy robots (Cylindroids). They can move, attack, or occupy resource chambers. Additionally, players will receive benefits or penalties (stress) according to their distance to Alpha Bot.<br/><br/>The game ends when Alpha Bot reaches the last chamber. The players tally the victory points, which can be earned in different ways: Through successful resource deliveries, by upgrades on their robot, by fulfilling other objectives, etc. Then, each player's victory points is reduced by the amount of stress they incurred during gameplay, and the player with most remaining points wins the game.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZnmbL5is4SxhKk42iXDLsw__thumb/img/QvpKGKYd--cKzkudBeu-k7CgmfQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5741971.png","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZnmbL5is4SxhKk42iXDLsw__original/img/GzmRXMvqtjTu8xvlDYV8lYxHCxA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5741971.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2021,"publisher":"2Tomatoes Games","designer":"Fernando Barbanoj","artist":"Pedro A.

Sometimes raw materials can help you to heighten the proceeds of actions. The action &quot;Work&quot; can get you raw materials. The type of landscape you are currently standing on determines how much work it is to get hold of a certain raw material. Raw materials used in the game are: wood, flax, stone, flint, clay and iron ore.<br/><br/>Butchering animals can not only get you food, but also skins, bones and tendons.<br/><br/>Exploring cards adds to your status. It also opens up more cards to be developed.<br/><br/>To develop a card, you need to &quot;pay&quot; the food and materials depicted on the card.<br/><br/>Once you have developed a card, you can use the tool, equipment or knowledge of this card to your advantage.

Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge. To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.<br/><br/>from review by Nickjost:<br/>Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.<br/><br/>There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board.

Experienced players should be able to play a campaign game in a weekend.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios designed to be fun, challenging mini-games in their own right, each playable in an afternoon. An array of variants and optional rules offers enough scope to make TW most replayable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website)The War: Europe 1939-1945 (TW) is Compass Games&rsquo; new WWII strategic level game combining all the best features of the genre into an intuitive, challenging new game. While offering all the expansive features of the WWII Monster Game genre (such as U-Boat warfare, diplomacy, espionage, strategic bombing, jets, rockets and numerous variants for each Major Power), TW also offers tremendous scope in its 12 scenarios (see below).<br/><br/>Although not a card driven game (and thus a good candidate for solitaire play), TW includes card play for the U-Boat War, Strategic Bombing, Espionage and Counter Espionage and naval warfare. The cards add elements of bluff and surprise more traditional hex-and-combat-table games cannot. But they&rsquo;re optional, so TW can be played solitaire in a way CDG&rsquo;s and block games cannot. Between two (or more) skilled players, no two games are ever likely to be the same. For multiplayer games, up to five gamers can play Campaign Games as Italy, Germany, France, the U.S., Britain and USSR.<br/><br/>For the hard-core military and naval history buff, TW addresses the details of WWII strategy: what if the Germans really built the carrier Graf Zeppelin; what if Mussolini had upgraded the quality of Italian forces; what if Stalin hadn&rsquo;t shot many of his best generals during the purges; what if the U.S. had entered the war earlier&hellip;or later; what if the British had been able to mobilize the Empire and the Dominions more effectively; what if the U.S. had developed the atomic bomb early enough to use in Europe, and so on.<br/><br/>Although the game is the result of extensive research by its designer, TW isn&rsquo;t a simulation and isn&rsquo;t intended to be. It&rsquo;s a &quot;gamer&rsquo;s game&quot; with quick, user-friendly combat systems on land, in the air and at sea. Veteran gamers familiar with classic WWII strategic level games should pick up the game very quickly. For new recruits, the short scenarios teach the basics, but can be played as stand-alone games in their own right.

Peace is a service that can be bought...for tribute to the Assyrian King&quot;.<br/><br/>The Assyrians were the innovators of siege warfare. All siege techniques like rams, towers, undermining city walls have been developed to mastery by the Assyrians. Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.<br/><br/>Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.<br/><br/>In 722 BC, Sargon II becomes King in Nineveh as new &quot;King of the World&quot;. A couple of problems threaten the strongest and most effective Army the world has seen so far.<br/><br/>In the West an Assyrian Army is inflicting a hunger siege on Samaria in Israel. Will the Egyptian Pharaoh interfere?<br/><br/>In the North the rampaging Uratu Kingdom is threatening the Assyrian borders.<br/><br/>In the South Mardukkapallidin has become King of Babylonia. He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him.<br/><br/>In the East the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished!<br/><br/>Will you as the Assyrian King maintain your Empire? Or will you as Babylonia, Mede, Elam, or Egypt free the world from Assyrian Tyranny?<br/><br/>Assyrian Wars is a multi player game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse.<br/><br/>Assyrian Wars is a point to point game.  Assyrian Wars gives an easy entry for beginners.  Still the game provides complex games situations depending on players strategy. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.<br/><br/>For the experienced players there are challenging specials like Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Bowmen, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Horsebowmen, and Chariots.<br/><br/>Assyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them.

It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.<br/><br/>The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.<br/><br/>Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.<br/><br/>Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.<br/><br/>Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.<br/><br/>This information is derived from the website of Phantastische-Spielewelten.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de</a><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XuN5YEHFqf1ES3MJktOCVw__thumb/img/gFBSzzT0KmYTedvlQwvTXL384KI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic253032.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XuN5YEHFqf1ES3MJktOCVw__original/img/Ldm7yl_lqKMUVSvtpOKp-X0B5xQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic253032.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2007,"publisher":"Phantastische-Spielewelten","designer":"Lutz Stepponat","artist":"Swen Papenbrock, Lisa Wilkens","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[3,4],"goodPlayers":[2,5],"avgRating":6.63013,"avgWeight":3.0909},{"bggId":342372,"name":"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – The Adventure Game","description":"ADVENTURES IN THE WORLD OF SKYRIM!<br/><br/>Before the Dragonborn came to Skyrim&hellip;.<br/><br/>You are surviving members of the Blades, a legendary group who long protected the Empire of Tamriel! Abandoned by the empire, you must work together to thwart a plot that threatens the whole of Skyrim<br/><br/>Build a unique character in the world of the Elder Scrolls. Choose between a Nord, Dunmer, Imperial, Altmer, Khajiit or Orsimer. Equip your character with a wide range of weapons, spells and armour. Travel across the Holds of Skyrim to places like Riften, Solitude, Falkreath and Whiterun. Attempt a huge range of evolving quests that change the game with each decision, Explore the wilderness. Gain side quests from mysterious characters. Delve into ancient ruins and tombs. Battle Draugr, Frostbite Spiders, Dragons, Dwemer Constructs and Daedra. The deeper you delve, the deadlier your foes will become. Gain experience and amazing treasures. Upgrade and enchant your gear. Level up your character with a wide range of unique skills and abilities. Play through six chapters of two huge campaigns spanning 25 years in the history of Skyrim in this endlessly replayable boardgame.<br/><br/>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim &ndash;  The Adventure Game is a 1-4 player co-operative game of adventure and exploration across Skyrim. Players take the roles of heroes involved in epic quests, working together to defeat their enemies and exploring the vast expanse of Skyrim. You will be able to choose character miniatures like the Khajiit, Nord, or High Elf; plan your strategy with weapons or spells; and fight your way through forgotten mines, Draugr-infested tombs, or ancient Dwemer cities to find ancient treasures and increase your power.<br/><br/>The players must keep an eye out as the threat increases across Skyrim as Dragons, Daedra, Trolls, and more roam the lands and wreak havoc across the holds. Players need to work together to keep the lands free, whilst balancing the demands of their most important quests.<br/><br/>The base game is divided into two campaigns of three chapters each. The decisions the players make from their first turn have a distinct effect on the unfolding story and encounters, making the whole campaign experience different every time you play. You can even save your progress after each game and start the next chapter with the same character, equipment, and skills.<br/><br/>With the numerous choices of characters, gear, magic, and skills matched with the many decisions each player makes through their quests, there are literally hundreds of hours of gameplay, with some stories not even seen based on your early decisions. The face of Skyrim can change during the game, impacting the course of the players' experience in subsequent chapters. At any time, the players can simply reset, choose another character and play style, make different choices, and experience things differently. Alternatively, pick a chapter that sounds fun and drop in to just play that adventure as a one-off.<br/><br/>Key mechanics:<br/><br/>A Living Board<br/>The game board represents the province of Skyrim. Players move their characters &mdash; represented by 32mm scale plastic miniatures &mdash; across the region, visiting Strongholds, exploring dungeons and meeting interesting characters as the story unfolds. But they are not the only ones there; roaming monsters appear, blocking roads and threatening the peace in Skyrim. Several game effects could lead to the fall of a Stronghold so players need to keep an eye on the state of unrest and the active dangers across the board.<br/><br/>Customizable Characters<br/>There are no classes in Skyrim. Each character has a different starting innate ability and additional abilities that are unlocked as they learn specific skills, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are tied to a gameplay style. For example, even though Nords shine when they are developed with a focus on warrior skills and equipment, a player could decide to make their Nord a spellcaster, or a summoner, and still retrain midway through the game after finding an amazing sword they really want to use. Players can change their progression path mid-game, and enjoy many different play styles.<br/><br/>Upgradeable Equipment<br/>There are plenty of equippable items: weapons, pieces of armor, trinkets, etc. Most of these items can be customized; by either Enchanting or Upgrading them in a Stronghold. When Upgrading or Enchanting an item, the player draws an Enchantment/Upgrade card, and slots it underneath the item, altering its properties. A piece of armor can be Upgraded so it becomes better against Heavy Attacks, for example, and it can also be Enchanted so it helps the character regenerate Stamina faster. When learning the Smithing and the Enchanting skills, the players get to draw more cards and choose between them, making the experience of customizing equipment richer and letting them focus on the playstyle they prefer. Furthermore, when playing in a group, one player can specialize their character in Enchanting or Smithing and upgrade all their allies' items by meeting in a Stronghold, adding another layer of cooperative gameplay.<br/><br/>Quests in Cards<br/>The story in the game is told using Quest cards. Players draw Main Quests &mdash; those that push the narrative forward &mdash; and Personal Quests &mdash; side stories gained by exploring the vastness of the province of Skyrim. By completing or failing them, the story progresses. Many of these Quests give the players a choice at the end. This choice chains the Quest with a new one, creating a branching story that changes every time the game is played. Failing a quest doesn&rsquo;t mean losing the game; instead, failure often becomes another way of choosing. The cards are organized in a way in which, if a card is removed as a result of Quest being failed or a game effect is triggered, the next card will take its place, dramatically changing the story.<br/><br/>Combat System<br/>With an assortment of weapons, ranging from daggers to bows, players will be able to engage in combat with dangerous enemies, whether they be in a dungeon or part of a questline. Each weapon and spell will inform the player what attacks it can perform and how much Stamina or Magicka they&rsquo;ll have to spend to use them. The player will roll the custom dice and attempt to overcome each weapon&rsquo;s specific Skill Tests; hitting with heavier weapons is bound to be harder than hitting with lighter weapons. Combat is fast, exciting, and deadly, although strategy is a key factor to success. Some enemies, in fact, will employ unorthodox tactics, including the ability to heal themselves or wear nearly impenetrable armors.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawling<br/>Players can visit increasingly dangerous caves, mines, tombs, ruins, and Dwemer cities across Skyrim. Dungeons are built with cards each representing a major threat in that area of the dungeon. It might be a terrifying Draugr or a surprise trap that, if you&rsquo;re lucky, one of the characters may be capable of disabling. As the characters level up, the lower-level adversaries are discarded, scaling the difficulty of the dungeons along with the player&rsquo;s level. The more you visit a certain type of dungeon, the more likely you will see its more fearsome denizens, albeit with better rewards!<br/><br/>Cooperative<br/>The whole game is fully cooperative. Players are encouraged to discuss their strategies and to collaborate to advance in their own storylines. Each player will be following their own storyline, joining together at the end of each chapter, when their plots are woven together into an epic finale for the whole party. <br/>There are some situations where characters, even if they have the same overall goal, find themselves on opposite sides of a struggle, and may interfere with each other as they progress. This gives an interesting layer of light competitive gameplay, whilst still keeping the cooperative nature of the game in the forefront.<br/> Expansions<br/>The Dawnguard expansion will add a third campaign with three additional chapters to play through, new characters, dungeon adversaries, treasures, events, and more. One of our expansions will make the Ghosts of the Blades haunt you throughout Skyrim during the first Campaign of the game and another threatens devastation to Skyrim in the form of a great dragon! There is much more to be revealed through the Gamefound campaign. The team has planned for a massive upgrade kit converting all the wandering monsters over to 32mm scale plastic miniatures which are all compatible in scale with the miniatures game The Elder Scrolls Call to Arms. More information will be revealed in the run-up to the launch of the board game<br/> <br/>All in all, the Elder Scrolls Skyrim Adventure Game will offer players dozens and dozens of hours of adventure exploring the game world. Expansions will ensure there&rsquo;s even more Skyrim to be had.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTa3H9kWaUjlrldh8qgYlg__thumb/img/1zvLGq6-VjjEAUBMuHIOrwlj_YU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7203331.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTa3H9kWaUjlrldh8qgYlg__original/img/BcTtFMEmCQ--xnSh4SYqSEYbhO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7203331.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2022,"publisher":"Modiphius Entertainment","designer":"Javier Angeriz-Caburrasi, Juan Echenique, Stefano Guerriero, Rob Harris","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[1,2,4],"goodPlayers":[3,null],"avgRating":7.48615,"avgWeight":3.1429},{"bggId":25841,"name":"Le Grand Empire","description":"Le Grand Empire simulates the Napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 at a strategic level. Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.<br/><br/>The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.<br/><br/>The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.<br/><br/>At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance.

After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?<br/><br/>Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions &mdash; including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead &mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires. That concept was inspired by the Legend of the Burning Sands CCG, which in turn is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG: in those real-life games, tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions.<br/><br/>The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game.  Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.  The real-life release is not a collectable game, but a boxed set with a set distribution of cards. This boxed set represents the fictitious 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing characters for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.<br/><br/>So there's 3 levels of reality at play here:<br/><br/><br/>     the CCG game called Romance of the Nine Empires, pictured in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, which is played by the characters at Gen Con Indy 2012 and is 15 years old;<br/>     the fantasy world of Countermay, which is pictured in the CCG game and whose history is shaped by the players of the CCG game;<br/>     the real card game Romance of the Nine Empires, edited by AEG in 2013, which comes in a boxed set and is inspired by (and presented as) the fictitious CCG.<br/><br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jOQXcB_QrzZMMfRzcMSeGg__thumb/img/l-6G2hAXCTkduL0VtnrTDU-qVGw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1683905.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jOQXcB_QrzZMMfRzcMSeGg__original/img/Caiwut1pe4riZZ1CV_e3FP7Zteo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1683905.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2013,"publisher":"Alderac Entertainment Group","designer":"Mark Wootton","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2],"goodPlayers":[3,4,5],"avgRating":6.19122,"avgWeight":3.1},{"bggId":162141,"name":"Swedish Parliament 2014","description":"In Swedish Parliament 2014, you play as one of eight Swedish parties and compete to become the most influential party after the 2014 parliament elections.<br/><br/>The most influential party is the one that becomes the &quot;center of gravity&quot; in the next cabinet.

The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.<br/><br/>The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.<br/><br/>The facts:<br/><br/><br/>     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.<br/>     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).<br/><br/><br/>The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.<br/><br/>In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.<br/><br/>In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Three 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps, <br/>560 playing pieces, <br/>rules, <br/>three scenario books, <br/>political events and charts.<br/><br/><br/>Note: <br/>The maps are not mounted like those in JP's Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. <br/> The game marries up with JP's Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5ajV-d5xwUzMZodmXTws8A__thumb/img/W6D6B5culF0x2NuhkacCNiRGmqc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic237697.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5ajV-d5xwUzMZodmXTws8A__original/img/GOlC3Gsx1Mt-dwF9R64A7-ZJc10=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic237697.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2003,"publisher":"Avalanche Press Ltd.","designer":"Brian L.

A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.<br/><br/>The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.<br/><br/>The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.<br/>Counters = 200<br/><br/>Other credits:<br/><br/>Graphic Design: Redmond A.

You and your friends will assume the roles of corporations, competing to prepare Kaimas-2 (the first planet outside of our solar system capable of supporting human life) for a large-scale colonization effort. The corporation that contributes the most will become the market leader going forward!<br/><br/>The game includes three distinct game styles with the following victory conditions:<br/>​<br/><br/>     Basic Simulation &ndash; the first player to reach 7 Mission Stars wins.<br/>     Early Arrival &ndash; the last year is triggered when a player reaches 10 Mission Stars. The player with the most stars at the end of that year wins.<br/>     Planned Arrival &ndash; the player with the most Mission Stars after 5 years wins.<br/><br/><br/>To earn Mission Stars, you must expand your resource base and develop your crew with specific combinations of traits and classes. Unlike many euro style games where players focus on their own playing area and can only affect each other indirectly, Lander enables players to directly impact each other's strategies through various game mechanics, such as take that and variable player powers.<br/><br/>At it's core, Lander is a game of options. On any given turn, you'll have many potential directions to go in, which gives you a lot of flexibility in how you plan your strategy. It also enables you to pivot when something unanticipated happens (e.g. acid rain reduces the colony's food production, a rival corporation relocates one of your structures, the mission you were working towards gets completed just before you can grab it!). This means that no matter how bleak things may seem, there's almost always a way back in!<br/><br/>Unique leadership abilities and action cards can be used to pull back your opponents or further your own interests, while event cards will force you to make difficult choices that can impact yourself or the entire colony. Lander is like life. You will experience highs and lows and be faced with a series of challenges that will force you to solve problems and pivot your strategy. It's not meant to be easy (think Matt Damon in the Martian). You are self-interested corporations, struggling to survive on a foreign planet - don't be surprised if the planetary conditions change or your colleagues put something toxic in your soup.<br/><br/>While some orders in the game are commonly used across game styles and player counts, others are more situational. For example, negotiation provides a novel framework for trading resources and cards between corporations with the use of a timer and collateral. Typically, a 2-player game won't see any negotiation, but it can become very common in a 3 or 4-player game, especially if one player starts to pull away. Observations are often used sparingly in the first couple years, but can become quite strategic in later years, as you study your opponents' actions and try to time your moves just right.<br/><br/>Lander is a game that often requires a few plays for you to really start appreciating its depth. As you get familiar with the mechanics and cards, you'll start to see there is a game within a game, whereby the study of your opponents' actions is crucial for developing your own strategy. Similar to poker, players can study their opponents' hands, crew and orders to predict what they might be trying do. The interplay between reading your opponents, using your observations, bluffing and playing your action cards becomes the game within the game. Knowing how and when to employ these different tactics is of course, up to you to master...<br/><br/>Your story begins here!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LTNTIWaKIGaOmHmI7TlBkQ__thumb/img/3O-hgyL8z7N8qu5vKEuKU72kRAw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5059038.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LTNTIWaKIGaOmHmI7TlBkQ__original/img/1-755Ej1FAnlnqNyzOKsKACxWkY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5059038.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":0,"publisher":"Intrepid Games","designer":"Daniel Alexander (II), Sean Lemon","artist":"Elias Stern","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3],"avgRating":7.45079,"avgWeight":3.3333},{"bggId":8056,"name":"Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942","description":"Operation Shoestring: The Guadalcanal Campaign, 1942, is a game covering the air, land, and sea battles between the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps and the forces of the Japanese Empire on and around Guadalcanal Island in 1942. The unit scale is company-level for the ground game and squadron-level for the air forces. Naval counters represent one ship for carriers and battleships, two ships for cruisers, and destroyer flotillas.<br/><br/>&quot;We struck at Guadalcanal to halt the advance of the Japanese. We did not know how strong he was, nor did we know his plans. We knew only that he was moving down the island chain and that he had to be stopped ... From that moment in 1942, the tide turned, and the Japanese never again advanced.&quot; -- Maj. Gen. Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC, Commanding General, 1st Marine Division<br/><br/>The strategic situation at the time found both sides relatively equal in strength for one of the few times in the war. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the ensuing string of rapid conquests, Japanese fortunes had taken a turn for the worse. At the Battle of Coral Sea, American carrier-based air power fought to a draw with the vaunted Japanese, serving notice that the Japanese would not be allowed to project naval power with impunity. Later, the Battle of Midway saw four Japanese carriers sunk, evening the odds in the Pacific and laying the groundwork for the first American offensive of the Pacific War.<br/><br/>The Japanese, having been blunted at Midway, turned their attention to the south, extending a siring of bases southeast through the Solomons chain. They established a seaplane base at Tulagi, and began construction of a large airfield on the island of Guadalcanal. Air pow- er based at these airfields would be able to effectively threaten American supply lines between the west coast and Australia. Shocked by the news of the Japanese airfield construction in the Solomons, the American high command gathered all available marine forces for a strike at Guadalcanal. The main force was the American First Marine Division assembled at Wellington, New Zealand. This Division, understrength and less than half trained, would bear the brunt of driving the Japanese from Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>As the morning of August 7, 1942 dawned, weeks of boredom for the Marines and occasional skirmishes for the air forces were replaced by real battle. The Marines went ashore, first at Tulagi, then Guadalcanal, and finally at Gavutu/Tanambago. The Japanese, caught unprepared by the audacious amphibious assaults, nevertheless recovered quickly and sent air, land, and naval forces to Guadalcanal. The resulting clashes shaped the future of the war in the Pacific.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring simulates this fascinating campaign &amp; includes special rules to simulate such unique aspects of the battle as: Innovative combat resolution, integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, shore bombardment, air support, and even Banzai charges into one easy-to-use system. Full-featured naval and air game that integrates with the island fighting. Engineers to rebuild airfields and construct improved positions. Japanese hidden units and limited U.S. intelligence.<br/><br/>Operation Shoestring can be played by one to four players. Solitaire play is possible with a slight modification to the naval rules, while team play is easily accommodated with one player commanding the ground forces and one the air and naval forces for each side. An introductory scenario, several short scenarios, and a grand campaign game allow players to experience the battle for Guadalcanal over a variety of time spans.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3.5 days<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Operation Shoestring rulebook<br/>Six single-side printed player aid cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/>One counter storage tray<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-30 depending on scenario<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jhXzIXkCLXdfq1fTikdtQg__thumb/img/gGFMK-Jp-ilWeaO-_0PafMpUM04=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1630950.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jhXzIXkCLXdfq1fTikdtQg__original/img/yX3t-xhdKFTUiXEXQxsQywYH0k0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1630950.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":1990,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Gene Billingsley","artist":"Rodger B.

The primary goal of the master book is to provide the basic structure and rules to handle campaign-level issues.

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...<br/><br/>Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.<br/><br/>The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.<br/><br/>The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xUhRmZLFxRY8k6StocpI0Q__thumb/img/h477qBpPphksiky4v0-QocVGwrM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic16960.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xUhRmZLFxRY8k6StocpI0Q__original/img/JLL6y7Hxi1eaJOjru376-i4KyiQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic16960.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":7,"yearPublished":1997,"publisher":"OSG (Operational Studies Group)","designer":"Nicolas Pilartz, Kevin Zucker","artist":"Christopher Moeller","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6,7],"goodPlayers":[1,2,3,null],"avgRating":6.43571,"avgWeight":3.3846},{"bggId":10822,"name":"The Seven Years World War","description":"Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #221.<br/><br/>Seven Years World War (7YWW) is a wargame simulating the global conflict of 1756-63.

Unlike many 4x games, War for Indagar puts combat at the center of the struggle, with heroes squaring off in epic combat and using abilities and spells unlocked as they gain experience. To participate in combat, players roll dice based on attack and defense characteristics; do enough damage and you send your opponent into retreat and gain the land they were defending.<br/><br/>Games of War for Indagar last for ten turns or until a player earns 10 primacy points. Primacy is earned by claiming land with new outposts, defeating the enemy champion, or mining the precious spirits from the well at the center of the battlefield.

Simple enough for beginners, the game system also has subtle depths that will provide a satisfying challenge for the experienced player.<br/><br/>The VOID rulebook contains all the rules of play, an armory section and army lists for the four human armies: Viridians, Junkers, Syntha and VASA, as well as the mysterious alien race, the Koralon.<br/><br/>A miniature line covering all five armies supports VOID. The models are manufactured in lead-free white metal and polyester resin. The range includes basic troops for the armies, support figures and characters, and larger kits such as the Tiger APC, a huge four-legged walking vehicle.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5xMTVMgQOwPwqwzAtdsq1g__thumb/img/5_VhMSSAskMfBbXPgA4_7-QX2lA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic77875.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5xMTVMgQOwPwqwzAtdsq1g__original/img/edlQPw-jZep0YQ3MA4Va4taEP8M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic77875.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"yearPublished":2003,"publisher":"i-Kore Ltd.","designer":"Mark Brendan, John Grant (I)","artist":"Stuart Beel, James Worrall, Luca Zontini","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4,5,6,7,8],"goodPlayers":[1,3,null],"avgRating":6.87209,"avgWeight":3.3333},{"bggId":340865,"name":"Lords of Ragnarok","description":"In this 1-4 player strategic board game, you will lead a unique, asymmetric hero and their army, trying to be the ultimate victor in a war that unfolds over approximately 120 minutes.

Play as one of four Princes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Accumulate resources by exploration, building mines and temples, and fighting for key positions. In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.<br/><br/>Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zyHadVhVueZI1EnkWrMtrQ__thumb/img/EYzZpEclKMadN50A5a5IgjbmQbI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic288457.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zyHadVhVueZI1EnkWrMtrQ__original/img/YtDapr7KNT3y3AwRHxG5fLCqzWw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic288457.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"yearPublished":2008,"publisher":"Peregrine Games","designer":"Tom Reeves","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[2,4],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.55695,"avgWeight":4.2308},{"bggId":247394,"name":"EXO: Mankind Reborn","description":"EXO: Mankind Reborn takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has survived natural catastrophes taking refuge in underground caves (like the famous Son Doong cave) for centuries while on the surface, the only ones that have managed to survive are the insects, because of their adaptability and their affinity to a mysterious energy that arises during the natural catastrophes: the EXO-energy.<br/><br/>In EXO, you will become the incarnation the chosen heroes of the main tribes that inhabit the underground caves to unveil the secrets of the EXO-energy.<br/><br/>This is a co-operative survival board game in which players will experience the pressure of having to obtain the necessary resources to survive and fight the insects swarm all while they are fulfilling the objectives of each mission in a story that is told throughout a campaign.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is divided into two phases: Day and night.

Those dice generate the most valuable currency in the game -- Envelopes of Cash -- which are used to lure the athletes to your program.  To succeed, you need to balance the benefits of your cards, which make recruiting easier, with the nuts and bolts of actually getting out there and recruiting, by sending lots of recruiting mail, traveling to visit the athletes in their home states, and most importantly, slipping them those valuable tokens of your affection in little colored envelopes.<br/><br/>You only have 12 months to gather as many different recruits across a variety of football positions (like QB, LB, etc.), so the tension between less income now vs. more income later plays a role in shaping your strategy.  Should you jump out to a quick start and get the best recruits before your opponents, or should you build up a big stash of envelopes of cash and have a major blow out month towards the end of the year.  Or can you build a strategy more around your personnel and culture, turning their special abilities into a victory point engine and leave the grubby business of bribes to others?<br/><br/>Envelopes of Cash lets you be the head coach of a major football program, working closely with your bag men to make sure you come out on top in the race for the most recruiting points.

By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.<br/><br/>Every turn, players play a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of cards, building up the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;ready deck&rdquo; and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can &quot;obtain&quot; a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain &quot;meditation&quot; cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards.  Players may also &quot;obtain&quot; Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.<br/><br/>Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.<br/><br/>There are four Sects of Immortals in Demonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other&rsquo;s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it&rsquo;s battle&rsquo;s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.<br/><br/>The enemy of the game are the &ldquo;Heart-Eaters;&rdquo; demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites &ndash; called &ldquo;Miasma&rdquo; which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack &ldquo;Treasure Beasts&rdquo; which can grant players special abilities once they are won.<br/><br/>In one &quot;wave&quot; of Demonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one &quot;Overlord;&quot; a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters. Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlun is not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards.

Prepare for augmented fun, major geeky learning, and diminished boredom!<br/><br/>Players begin by choosing 1 of 13 musical instruments that grant variable player powers. To win the game, players must draft the right Note cards to their hands, according to the active Key Signature tile. Notes are then played to the field, and combined to form Chords. When a Chord that matches the current Key Signature is completed by a player, that Key Signature Tile is claimed! The first Player to collect 3 Key Signatures is the Bringer of Harmony, the Destroyer of Dissonance, the Lord of the Chords!<br/><br/>On your turn, you first draft 3 cards, then make 3 moves. You may spend your moves by (1) playing a Note card, or (2) playing an Action card.<br/><br/>Other ways to spend moves include: (A) Moving a Note card from one chord to another, (B) buying Accidental Tokens, or (C) spending 2 moves to draft 1 additional card.<br/><br/>Note cards must be diatonic to be played, according to the active Key Signature. Action cards range from punny composer cards like &ldquo;More-zart&rdquo;, which allows you to draw 2 more cards, to powerful music theory concepts like &ldquo;Major 7th Steal&rdquo;, which allows you to turn the tables by stealing another player's hard earned Key Signature tile!<br/><br/>Accidental Tokens make it easier to complete chords. They are placed on Note cards to raise or lower the note by a semitone/half step, depending on whether the sharp or flat side is facing up, respectively. Accidental tokens are bought by selling a dotted quarter note/dotted crotchet worth of Note cards.<br/><br/>All cards are drafted from a pool of 6 cards, so memory, prediction and counter-strategizing are key to victory.

On the Astral Plane, the Hunters try to reach and exorcise the Entity hidden in the heart of darkness of the House. The Hunters must advance along the 12 Axes of Power, weakening the House and destroying its web of evil by exorcising the Entity's power from individual rooms in the Manor. The House tries to trap the Hunter's Psyches and cast their Astral bodies adrift on this plane.<br/><br/>On the Material Plane, the physical manifestation of the House, the Hunters search for discoveries to help them on the Astral Plane, as the House materializes Physical and Psychic Haunts against them through its Foci of Evil. The House tries to take possession of the Hunter's physical bodies, destroy them, and absorb their souls. The Hunters use various tools and strengths to defend themselves against the Haunts.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZq9hLY2QnuA9N8eKlfKMQ__thumb/img/f5pDIwXVQPbNqryP90jp-B5Hf7g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic12610.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZq9hLY2QnuA9N8eKlfKMQ__original/img/5qrGAscLyXWS33aPa3CmX5tW3Uw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic12610.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1983,"publisher":"SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.)","designer":"David Marshall","artist":"Kristine L.

In the basic game, two, three, or four players control mining companies that mine asteroids for ore, gas, and highly dangerous shards of CT (contra-terrene matter -- a name for antimatter lifted from the Seetee novels of Jack Williamson). These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)<br/><br/>In the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low. The PKF player achieves partial victory if the price of either commodity is below 200 credits at the end of the game, or decisive victory if the prices of both commodities are below 200 credits.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tVNkYpWDlB_yk3uv3l7_hg__thumb/img/g7VRxaJUaNPyZd-E957AkPDt-WU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic136054.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tVNkYpWDlB_yk3uv3l7_hg__original/img/dWLduY8sMytE1Sfzx2gpr86Krt4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic136054.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":1979,"publisher":"Game Designers' Workshop","designer":"Frank Chadwick, Marc W.

Expedition Zetta includes 3D-models of spaceships, gorgeous art, and a modular game system. In this game for 1-5 players, you and your fellow travelers each represent a country in a maiden voyage of the first starship to ever use a newly developed warp drive. The goal is to brave the unknown and collect discoveries in four different star systems. Though you may have to cooperate, one player will bring special fame and fortune to their home country. Will it be you?<br/><br/>In Expedition Zetta, you start the game by recruiting 1-4 crew members, then you will:<br/><br/><br/>    Discover strange planetary systems, randomly generated each game based on the latest scientific data<br/>    Find exotic new substances never before seen<br/>    Develop exo-products that can advance human technology<br/>    Gain new knowledge<br/>    Encounter new forms of life or ruins and settlements of vanished, ancient alien civilizations with their promise of both danger and discovery<br/>    Perhaps encounter another star-faring civilization whose members might even become part of your crew, making it not only international but interstellar<br/>    See crew interactions that can lead to romance or intrigue, which can either help or hinder you<br/><br/><br/>Every game plays differently! Each game includes four planetary systems. After warping together to a distant star, you travel with your crew individually between planets, searching for life and substances or trying to construct exo-products. If the life you find is intelligent, you may even interact with it. The discoveries are your main source of Fame.<br/><br/>The revolutionary Zetta Planetary System Generator, used in the advanced game, can generate as many different star systems in the game as there are in the known universe, each with its own unique characteristics and its own name. Thus, no two voyages to the stars will ever be the same! During the warp stage in the advanced game, you interact with the other players' crew members to gain advantages. Romance or intrigue may occur, with varying effects.<br/><br/>Apart from the gameplay experience, a journey with Expedition Zetta will give you knowledge about stars and planets, along with memories of when you for instance managed to extract gems from a gaseous giant in a triple star system, from when you found life in a lenticular galaxy or when you managed to produce time crystals near a super-hot supergiant O-star.<br/><br/>Expedition Zetta has a basic version that is great for the whole family.<br/><br/>    Want a quick game?

It allows players to simulate the diplomatic, economic, and political maneuverings that preceded the Second World War, either as a stand alone game or as an expansion for A World at War.  (Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.)<br/><br/>&lt;From the publisher's website:&gt;<br/><br/>Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if:<br/><br/>- Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain.<br/>- Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently.<br/>- The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued.<br/>- Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression.<br/>- War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland.<br/>- Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces.<br/>- France had extended the Maginot Line.<br/>- de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted.<br/>- Britain had rearmed sooner.<br/>- Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them.<br/>- The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists.<br/>- A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece.<br/>- Atomic fission had been discovered earlier.<br/>- The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral.<br/>- War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. <br/>- YOU had been in command.<br/><br/>Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm's structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into.  Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following:<br/><br/>- Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value.<br/>- Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork.<br/>- Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other.<br/>- Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options.<br/>- Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains.<br/>- A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not.<br/>- Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships.<br/>- Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. <br/>- A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out.<br/>- No dice.<br/><br/>Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8lOV8iMB4a02WLqvCn8aKw__thumb/img/px9IPefIcY8V-Mqfyb6a_3LedzI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2454131.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8lOV8iMB4a02WLqvCn8aKw__original/img/uQC1DNjbu1Bqj0G3r0SzqDFvNV0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2454131.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"yearPublished":2015,"publisher":"GMT Games","designer":"Bruce Harper","artist":"Rodger B.

It takes place between two events revealing the working conditions of textile workers:<br/><br/>- On November 25, 1910, a fire occurred at a four-story factory in Newark, New Jersey. 25 factory workers, mostly young women, died.<br/>- On March 25, 1911, exactly four months after the Newark event, a fire engulfs the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, occupied by the Triangle Waist Company, causing the death of 146 workers.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/>&quot;Which Side are you on?&quot; is a historical and cooperative survival game that simulates the struggle of the workers in New York between the years 1910 and 1911; for their survival; against employer offensives; for the control of the means of production.<br/><br/>Workers pose and resource collection mechanisms allow for a fluid game; and a system of elements with their historical context, which facilitates immersion.<br/><br/>This game will particularly appeal to players who like adversity, cooperation, immersion, History ... and perseverance!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>1-A game lasts 10 turns.

Players start in the North Sea with an empty Longship each, surrounded by four countries: Denmark, Norway, Scotland and England. Players have to start with plundering at least one country each in order to get some initial resources to trade with. Trading is driven by differences in the countries' resources; each country produces 2 out of the 4 resources Cloth, Furs, Thralls and Mushrooms. Nearby countries differ on one resource only, while countries on opposite sides of the North Sea have a totally different set of resources. Long-distance trading is thus more profitable, but also more dangerous as changing weather conditions can make open sea-traveling fatal.<br/><br/>The countries themselves are weak in defense and easy to plunder. However, plundering a country weakens its trading potential, so that Vikings need to defend countries they build their trade on from Vikings plundering. Plundering a country also makes its population hostile to you, so that you can't build or repair Longships there, making you more vulnerable on expeditions to those countries. The key to success is thus to keep your hostilities at an optimal level.<br/><br/>Resources gained from trading or plundering can be sacrificed to the gods in order to gain additional actions. Sacrificing Thralls to Odin gets you new fresh men to throw into the fights, sacrificing to Thor lets you change the weather conditions, get yourself a beneficial trade wind or sink your foes with mighty storms. Mushrooms make you go berserk and fight and plunder more efficiently, while Freya helps cities grow and prosper and give more trading opportunities.<br/><br/>Resources can also be used to build new Longships, increasing the Viking's trading and military power. Just like in real life, the winner at the end of the game is the player with the most Longships.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NmC0zp1tn_7uLeDKFQugQA__thumb/img/BfnEUghvjUAChnDawoguT9cVe5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic575888.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NmC0zp1tn_7uLeDKFQugQA__original/img/c7WHoyv3JycislLKFjYmQHvb_j0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic575888.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2009,"publisher":"Mondainai","designer":"Harald Enoksson","artist":"","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4],"goodPlayers":[2,3,5,6],"avgRating":6.14348,"avgWeight":3.0},{"bggId":128219,"name":"Shafausa","description":"While digging on the slopes of Mount Ego, the Dwarves of Shafausa discovered a secret passage under the falls of the river Rain.

The exploitation of this area rapidly assured the small tribe a lifestyle far superior to anything previously known in Helvetia. Their neighbours, the Vampires of Zugriga, immediately realised the fantastic commercial potential of these discoveries. Thanks to a clever stock exchange system, they implicated the other Helvetian tribes in their dealings, for the joy and well-being of all &ndash; or so they claimed.<br/><br/>But wealth doesn't just fall from the sky, and it takes a good dose of know-how to be able to rival with the skill of a vampire...<br/><br/>In Shafausa, each player represents a Helvetian tribe that has come to propose a new monetary system based on an exchange of resources.

The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round having seven phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Extraction: Mines and certain buildings produce resources, with some buildings affecting how many resources something produces.<br/>    Order of Play: Players bid for turn order; as players drop from the bidding, they place their marker in line relative to those who have previously dropped out, so whoever stays in the longest can get the position he wants.<br/>    Buying and Constructing: In turn order, players buy at most one available building and construct two warehouses; alternatively, a player can pay to remove a building in order to make space for new buildings next round.<br/>    Management: Players can build mines, add miners to their workforce, construct purchased buildings, buy and sell resources, and construct new towns.<br/>    Administration: Players pay for buildings in reserve and check their resource limits; resource costs are adjusted based on past sales.<br/>    Speculation: In turn order, players pay to adjust the prices of various resources, with each price marker being adjustable only once.<br/>    End of Game Check: If one of a player's towns or warehouses has been filled, the game ends. Players then score points for their towns, mines, buildings, and so on, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to this &quot;Geek&quot; version of the rules, Shafausa includes a &quot;Colonial&quot; version in which players draft start-up tiles (instead of starting with pre-determined characters who come with specific buildings, funds, etc.) and a &quot;Family&quot; version that removes the &quot;Speculation&quot; phase, simplifies turn order, and otherwise makes the game less involved.<br/><br/>","thumbnailUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dF0FcTKMkREtU_otQ7hwQg__thumb/img/vy8LccMnMQlXVVzj9-wsLUYxSPg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1374975.jpg","imageUrl":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dF0FcTKMkREtU_otQ7hwQg__original/img/pMj7tDbtFCCc0k4BEABIEVUEh70=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1374975.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"yearPublished":2012,"publisher":"Helvetia Games","designer":"Christophe Borgeat","artist":"Lorenzo Mastroianni","honors":null,"bestPlayers":[4,5,6],"goodPlayers":[3],"avgRating":6.0079,"avgWeight":3.3077},{"bggId":201345,"name":"Kerosene","description":"From the publisher (translated):<br/>The first oil field in the world has just been discovered, the first oil companies have just been founded, one of the largest industries worldwide is about to unfold.

This 3-4 hour game thus lasts a maximum of twelve turns.<br/><br/>Players command infantry and cavalry armies, and for some factions fleets and aircraft. Leaders assist these units in movement and combat over land areas and sea zones. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for armies, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Factions thus use manpower to rebuild forces, and money to finance their actions. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor, with hits reducing them in strength or eliminating them outright. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is also rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there).<br/><br/>Finally, to keep the game from becoming too &quot;Risk&quot;-like, players can play various event cards.
